Sentiment Analysis Micro Service
# **Introduction**

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis and Cross-Selling Prototype, a game-changer in understanding customer sentiments and driving targeted cross-selling campaigns. This cutting-edge solution empowers businesses to unlock the true potential of customer feedback and optimize growth strategies like never before.

The project is divided into three main components:

1. Frontend: This component provides a user interface to interact with the sentiment analysis microservice. It allows users to input text data and receive sentiment analysis results.
2. Dataset: The dataset component consists of a pre-trained model or a labeled dataset used for training the sentiment analysis algorithm. It is essential for accurate sentiment analysis predictions.
3. Backend: The backend component serves as the core of the microservice. It receives text data from the frontend, performs sentiment analysis using the trained model, and sends back the results to the frontend.

# Features

 23 September 2022,Soham ShahSoham Shah,Good for Routine light work Life but not at all good for people of field working.,"These review is as per my Usage.Battery - Last for 5 days without connectivity and last for 2.5 days with connectivity. Drains fastee after it gets below 30%.Accuracy - All the details are accurate 95% but prefer to use porper medical grade instruments to check. Dont depend on tge watchModes - All the modes are good.Bluetooth Calling - Calling is best. At this price point but there are some drowbacks like it takes time to notify the caller details, battery drains very fast, it can be helful to merge call to your Bluetooth earphones.Quality - Straps quality are good, but not as Sturdy for rough job. Screen if not for rough usage. It gets scratches often.(If possible order screen cover or guard)Value for Money - If this watch is available for ₹1350 around then you should buy it definitely. But ita not worth of money if you spend more than ₹1500.",4,B0B5LVS732,Colour: black | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 20 October 2022,Abhishek,"At this price range , it's best","I have tried BOAT and FIREBOLT also and found this as the best so returned the other two.I will discuss the pros and cons but before that I must say that the accuracy of readings are pathetic especially sleep monitoring .All the smartwatches in the market at this price range doesn't give accurate results as smartbands... I am disappointed with that .. but why I finally chose to keep the Noise buzz and return boat wave lite and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ----Pros1. Good battery life , better than FIREBOLT ninja which was about 2 days.. Noise gives almost 3 to 4 days battery life with normal usage.2. Calling is quite good quality ( FIREBOLT was also good )3. The settings of DND , SMART DND, SILENT , VIBRATION is better.4. Vibration is good and really wakes u up unlike the other watches where vibration can't be adjusted and doesn't wake you up.. here vibration can be adjusted if you want more or less amount.Cons1. Pathetic accuracy. Don't take this watch if you are only looking for sleep monitoring , heart beat etc. It's better to buy a good smartband for that.2. Interface is not the best but it's okayI bought this calling watch for 1700 in the great Indian festival and I feel at this price range it was the best as I have used Boat wave lite(non calling watch at 1200) and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ( 1800rs ) .I finally decided to keep the Noise and return the rest.",4,B0B5LVS732,Colour: black | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 17 November 2022,Aneesh Mohan,"For the price, it is a good purchase but can be better","The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear, there's not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.Sleep tracking is decent.Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is goodAlso, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?",4,B0B5LVS732,Colour: black | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 16 September 2022,ThunderbirdThunderbird,"Great for calls, Good Battery life, Software needs improvement, value for money","Best for calls, Great on Battery life, comfortable too Wear.  Value for money.Main gripe is that it should do better in step counting.  The current deviation is about -20% from actual.Said in a line.... would be best if software was fixed.  If Noise is reading this, then, here's an attempt to listing them -1. Step counting to be fixed2. Automatic Sport detection doesn't work3. Improved Sport menu needed - for eg. Walking is under Running Sports.  Badminton is not found under Indoor sports, instead under Ball sports,. When choosing badminton, there's no option to simply start activity - instead, there are 3 more steps to set targets, type of activity and then start.4. I can see the messages received, but where's the messages menu item?!5. Should have a feature to set on-screen shortcuts to call, or start an activity.",4,B0B5LT655H,Colour: grey | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 9 March 2023,Arun Thomas,Good intro to Smart watches,"I am a regular badminton player and noticed that many of my peers have smart watches to track their sessions. I was kind of feeling left out and outdated on the technology arena. Also at my age I wanted to track health metrics and wanted to experience the magic of device telling me how many kms i ran or what my heart rate and all. Just to validate that i am healthy.So my primary motivation for buying smart watch was health rather than being able to take calls on watch.Coming to the performance of noise, sleep tracking feature has been good. But when it comes to my game Badminton it only tracks calories and doesn't track distance i ran or steps. That way it was disappointing. But as a workaround what i do is select outdoor running as the sport when i play badminton and that gives me distance covered along with calories burnt.Being able to receive and make calls at the price point of 1800/- is quite a steal i would say.But one thing which spooks me is that I get whatsapp notifications on my smart watch, although there is no whats app installed on smart watch. So i don't know what all information it can track behind my back.Its just been about a month i bought this watch and am still exploring various features.And yes just want to add that the battery charge retention is pretty good.Overall I would say noise is a perfect choice if you want to experiment and get introduced to the world ofsmart watches. Then you can decide whether to go for the ultimate Apple watch or Samsung or whatever.Personally I feel smart watch utility is hyped. It is not as revolutionary as tablets. So I didn't want to spend too much and this Noise watch fits my pocket perfectly well to experiment and experience together.",4,B0B5LT655H,Colour: grey | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,NOISE,SMART WATCH

It would be better with metal frame.* All the different sports modes work pretty good.* Calling function works great, mic and the speaker quality is quite good so no issues with that.*Overall the product is good",4,B0B5LWP12T,Colour: blue | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,NOISE,SMART WATCH

Not even whatsapp calls. Practically nothing more than a show off. Wrist turn awake to show time is a good feature especially with disable feature at night but it takes a second to turn on which is slow.Auto detection of workouts did show up after 5 mins of walking but never recorded anything.

""Overall; Waste of money""Major Issues : Health Hazards - It may explode , Bluetooth, pedometer, it detects heart beat of chairs and almost everything which is having a reflecting surface.1. No Customer Care number or email, You have to Riase Tickets and average time for a single reply which could be bogus reply takes 12-15 Days as per there description while raising tickets.2. Every device can have glitches, bugs but for resolving these issues software updates are released by OEMs but Noise dont have anything like that.3. Bluetooth range is very less and you can't check if you have been a watch which is having Bluetooth 4.1 or 5.3 anywhere.4. It uses Audio/Music Option for find my device option which is usually muted or put on low volume so you cant locate your phone as the alert tone will either be silent or at very low volume as you may have set while listening to your music or while watching YouTube.5. You can't use Watch as music player on watch, it plays music on phone- the speaker on watch are for just calling purpose.6. The watch has only vibrate option for alerts on watch itself, ringtone doesn't work.7. The watch faces are limited and mostly very bad , you cant set your personal photos as wallpaper or as watch faces.8. No Customer Support, no improvement based on reviews or suggestions or feedbacks as per customers.9. watch doesn't charge more than 98%, i.e. it stucks there, assuming the quality of service it may blast ( Health hazards)10. Pedometer doesn't work.11. It detects heart beat of chairs, handkerchief and also shows heart beat of 110 and 115.12. It doesn't detect sleep properly13.

Hence, it definately has a good battery life.I've tested the heart rate on non living surface to detect for accuracy and it is quite accurate in detection (did not detect heart rate on non living surface).Although the sleep function don't work regularly in the afternoon i guess but it works fine at night.Rest everything is good.Keep in mind :-It only has call rejection option with a quick reply and not talk via watch or attend call via watch.Same way, it only has option to read messages from notification and not to reply to them.",4,B09PNKXSKF,Colour: Rose Pink | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 30 August 2022,Zoomba,It's okay if you don't have a watch and want one,"- Has all basic features of a digital watch and some more to call it smartwatch.- Touch screen responsiveness is good.- Notifications for selected apps on phone is helpful.- Call reject is also helpful, for example, while driving.- There's no speaker or mic on this watch, so no Bluetooth calling (I didn't want BT calling).- Music controls work with some music apps but I didn't find it good enough to use it often.- Can't say much about accuracy of SpO2 sensor or the heart rate sensor. They do show some data and I am still trying to verify how good that data is.- The step counter is nuts. Not reliable. It overcounts steps.- There's absolutely no storage in this thing for spare watch faces or recording vitals and health data so if you're not connected to the phone, all data is probably getting lost. It does support syncing with Google fit which is reliably picking up data without me fiddling with it.- If you pair with another phone watch face gets reset to default one which is pretty stupid.- It took some getting used to the short screen timeout but I like that it conserves battery and keeps going for a week or more on single charge.- The tilt sensor to turn screen on (the raise to wake thing) is nice and useful.- 4 screen brightness levels are good.- Watch face customisation feature seems like they've played a joke on me. It's crappy. I'd have liked watch face additions on app updates, none so far in about a month of using this.- The strap is holding on good so far. I'd have liked a more skin-friendly strap because I tend to wear it more often than my analog watch.EDIT (06-09-2022):- I recently found that other Noise smartwatches have camera trigger function which is sorely missing from this one.- The sports modes are way too specific and there are only 8 of them; they should have added a generic one for activities not included in the 8 available.Of course now this is also unavailable.

(66 centimeter is by default ).but in heart bit, I have a doubt.Sleep Mode:- It,s not working properly and its till unclear to me.Message Notification:- accurate and proper.calories and distance measurement is up to the mark.so I can can say in this price segment it is best.1. best battery2. step count3. notification4.calories count perfect.Tthank you Noise and team Amazon.",4,B097R25DP7,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 11 April 2022,AbhijithAbhijith,Best looking smart watch under 2500,"If you're looking for the best Noise smartwatch under 2500, then you should go for Noise caliber. It has better display and has temp sensor.But Noise caliber is kinda big and makes the screen look too small.You should go for Noise ColorFit Grand if you want a normal sized watch. And there is no much of a difference between these watches any way.___________________________________________________________Screen: The screen is pretty good in this watch. The outdoor visibility is fine and it has a really good color reproduction. The touch response is really good comparing to other smartwatches at this price point.Performance: This watch performs really well there is no kind of lag while using this device.Health Tracking: I would say it is fine comparing the price. It is only 2500. There is Heart Rate monitoring, there is no Blood Pressure monitoring but there is SpO2 monitoring provided, Stress monitoring, sleep tracking,60+ workout modes.Heart Rate Monitoring: Works fine 8/10 accuracy compared to a medical equipment. It is fast and can easily show the resultSpo2:  I would say the most accurate feature in this watch. 9.5/10 accuracyStress monitoring: It gives a pretty accurate results. it basically shows your stress levelSleep tracking; i haven't use it yet so, i cant tellWork Out modes: It work! that's all i can say. in a good way though. It just helps you to organise your sport records. For example:- if you playing badminton and you select badminton in Work out mode, it tracks your calories, Max Heart beat, Average Heart Beat, Min Heart beat, Calories burned and workout time.If you cycling and select outdoor cycling in workout mode, it can also track distance and speed. you need to keep you phone with you with GPS turned on btw._______________________________________________________________________________________________|THE HEALTH TRACKING OPTIONS ARE NOT FO REPLACING MEDICAL EQUIPMENTS. SO PLEASE SEE A DOCTOR FOR MEDICAL CHECKUP DO NOT DEPEND OF SMARTWATCHES. SMARTWATCHES ARE NOT A REPLACEMT FOR MEDIACAL EQUIPMENTS. IT ONLY SHOWS YOU AN IDEA ABOUT YOUR HEALTH|_______________________________________________________________________________________________Watch faces: There are 150+ watchfaces you can choose from and you can do it by using Noisefit appBattery: The battery back up is really good and there is an option called battery saving mode which disables notification and lowers the brightness the the lowest setting which can significantly save the battery life.UI: It comes with Noise Colorfit UI. Typical noise UI. It looks great in my opinion. It is really smooth.Build Quality: The build quality is really good. It is not metal but it has really premium touch to it also the curved class. it just makes the watch look premiumWater resistance: it has IP68 water, dust and dirt resistance. I have summerged the watch in water and there is no problem_______________________________________________________________________________________________Overall : It is a really good smart watch and very good looking smartwatch in my opinion. You should go for this watch if you want LOOKS, BETTER DISPLAY, LAG FREE  UI.",5,B09NVPSCQT,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 24 September 2022,Joseph ManojJoseph Manoj,Review after 1 day of use ....,"Watch is pretty good for this discount prices ... Options are nice and by the way some people getting pulses for water bottle please update the watch firmware from noise fit app from playstore, after update and setting health suite works pretty good, like i tested with bottle it asked me to wear the watch properly and didn't gave me a reading... And when i sit calmly it comes around 82 to 87 and when i walk it comes around 102 to 105 which is pretty normal but not accurate, please note that these are not medical equipment to get accurate readings, this thing just give u an idea about your health and set your daily targets in sync with the noise fit appEdit 1 - it's pretty comfortable now couldn't notice the watch in hand unless i see it .... UI is little bit slow but responsive too .... what more could you ask for this price range ....",4,B09NVPSCQT,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 17 August 2022,Milind Shaligram,Overall value for money,"I just bought this phone few days back. It does basic features like steps count ,sleep tracking good. I haven't yet tested calls but sms alerts are good.  I feel wrist band needs to have two sizes small and regular. Current screen is good enough. I don't think so anything more or bigger size is needed.Couple of observations 1. Date needs to be in ddmmmyyyy format for India and not in mmddyyyy fomat. 2. Watch faces must have some bright colors which will show time and steps in those colors even in sunlight. That's viewed max times in this watch. 3. Some basic improvement in reminders...it needs to have repeat option in week ..daily weekly monthly ... 4. Overall watch is good till now and value for money .

 23 August 2022,Piyush,Disappointed,"I'm actually disappointed by the result of this watch, I spent 1 whole day to see youtube videos about this watch and then made the decision to buy it and now when i have it then i can see why it sucks. Quick reply don't work during call, you will be shown quick reply sent but in reality call keeps on ringing in phone. This can be fixed through one simple firmware update but oh well company don't care to fix anything. Secondly find my device is useless, it plays  my phone ringtone for bare 2 seconds and then cut off. How am i gonna find my phone then? Same problem when it comes to finding this watch via noisefit app. This watch only has a vibrating motor that's it. No speaker and noise company expect you to magically find your watch purely on basis of sensing vibration. They literally say ""hear the sound of vibration to find your watch""� thirdly sports mode is actually fake. I was standing still yet it was increasing calories in walking mode. Same happened with other modes as well, it increase calories by assuming that you are actually moving or doing some activity while taking location data from your phone. My phone was still and i was moving with watch on, yet got wrong data on display. Last flaw is sleep tracker it is useless, not accurate at all. It has one thing called REM Rapid eye movement. How are you going to see my eyes with no camera in this watch? How will you identify if i am still awake or asleep? If you have insomnia this watch will assume that you are sleeping cause it's night time. Only benefit of this watch is custom watch face. This you can never get on traditional watches and spo2 and heart rate sensors as well, and stress sensor as well. It is accurate i was having headache and it showed 45 stress level. Yet company labeled it normal till 59 which isn't right.Final thought if you want to measure heart rate, spo2 and stress level along with a waterproof watch then buy it. Otherwise don't fall for 60 sports mode gimmick.",1,B09NVP6HXY,Colour: Olive Green | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH

Once Yiu attend the call and talking after 5 Minutes Your watch ll start vibrating. You mean seriously??? . Notification or Sync delay for 5 Minutes ??The Raise wrist to wake up 30% wont work.

I mean to say it worked well since last 4 months and now it's not working....I have tried calling their customer care number but no response... I have also emailed them along with copy of invoice and warranty card before 10 days but no reply.... Also send them reminder email before 5 days but no reply....Don't know what to do.... I am really frustrated with this product.... They just want to sell the products without taking care of after sales.... Please do not buy it....I will have to stop using any product from this brand now.....,3,B097R25DP7,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 11 March 2022,Altaf Q.Altaf Q.,Value for money,Replaced due to battery draining issue.The replacement is 3 days old and so far only 35% battery used.All features works perfectly but don't know how accuracate it is.For 1999 it's a value for money.. kids are enjoying as they place a new watch face every day. Plus alarm function helps to get up on time as it vibrates pretty well. Wished it had gps function so that we can keep a track of kids when they go down to play..Only one watch face can be downloaded at a time. U need to delete earlier one to download a new one.

 1 December 2022,Sucheta DebnathSucheta Debnath,Product is overall good... Except the lock of strap,I have given 4 stars as because everything regarding the product is good but the buckle of the strap is not worthy... Because the buckle become black from it's original colour within 7-8 days... Otherwise product is good... Definitely go for purchasing this one but if possible order black one as it (the buckle) won't go any other colour rather than light colors.,4,B09PNKXSKF,Colour: Rose Pink | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 29 May 2022,Manoj Jha,Overhyped Smart Watch,"Used Noise ColorFit for about 2 weeks, average watch, but its not at all regular wearing watch. Here is my review for this product:Pros:1. Economical: purchased for Rs. 16992. good in looks3. front face can be customised or different default face can be chosen4. SPO2, Heart Beat, Sleep can be monitoredCons:1. It is not at all an ""all purpose"" watch which you can wear regularly.2. Pin strap system is very very very old and pin was lost within 2 week. now its of no use until you buy new strap .. pins not available in market. It should be pin less technology for straps, else is it not useful for any sports, ride, hiking, trekking or any activity as little pressure on strap and pin breaks out3. in watch face no option to keep it lock with accidental checks, this must be there. Watch should wake up on accidental touch but must be locked or lock screen must be there to use any further section of watch.4. No provision to keep weather on front screen, this is required for travellers, to access this you need to navigate then only you will know about weather5. No sound notification for searching smart watch, if you have kept smart watch and not able to locate it, then from mobile app you can search for watch but it will only vibrate that no very weak vibration, some sound must be there so that it can be tracked easily.6. notification fonts are of "" Baba Adam Era"" very nasty and not at all suitable for reading, they should work on some easy readable fonts.7. Strap quality is smooth but it sticks to skin, so not very skin friendlyNOT at all suitable for Sports, Activities, Riding, or any thing in which there is chance of even little touch on watch.",1,B097R25DP7,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse,NOISE,SMART WATCH

I wanted a light one, yes this is good. As I have a thin arm, the size is good. ( actually a bit big but it is easier to read messages through this).Quickly the pluses and minuses :Pluses :1. Light2. Easy to set up3. Lovely battery back up - as of now 8th day and going strong 38%4. Alarm works well ( I travel a lot so vibrating alarm is very useful)5. Reading quickly messages , rejecting calls is a boonMinuses :1. Sometimes getting connected to phone can be a challenge2. Watch faces - not so impressive3. American system of month- date can be irritating4.  There is a slight lag before the time comes upbut kinda got used to it. ( pull/ push it up the arm- it works fine) .Havent used it for rides /runs so cant say much about that.

 16 June 2022,Gurpreet Singh AroraGurpreet Singh Arora,The Best Budget Watch From Noise !,"So, I am writing the review of this watch after using it for 10 Days. I must say, Its an excellent product in this price range. The watch is very durable as used with high quality materials. The tracking sensors work fairly well, thou steps sensor counts 8 to 9 steps more, it can be resolved with an update !  Accuracy of this watch is between 80 to 85 percent which is quite fair enough at this price point. I am using it with my iPhone 11 & the app performs really well. The noise app is full of options & watch faces will blow you away thou it takes about a minute to upload a watch face. The app also works seamlessly with Apple Health default app & gives you more information of your tracked data of your entire day activity. Raise to wake feature works perfect & in the end the battery life of watch is really amazing, it gonna last you for at least 4 to 5 days or more when paired with your phone. Till date I have only charged it twice in last 10 days. To sum up, if you want a great quality watch with minimalistic features, Go For It guys .

 11 September 2021,Muhammad KPMuhammad KP,OK product with bad experience,"Writing a review in detail after using the product for last 1 week, i will be straight as possible.Watch: This is an acceptable product in this price range (bought for 2499/-). Design is smooth, material look durable and good quality. (It seems manufacturer is determined to copy apple watch style). Minimum functions. Sports mode has around 8 options (NO SWIM MODE, even though they boast it is IP68). Screen size is ok with good clarity. Battery seems holding as they claim (I have not activated automatic heart rate monitor, may be thats a reason battery holding).So if you are looking for a show piece or imitating smart watch, this is an ideal choiceApplication (NoiseFit ios variant): Worse than worst mobile app as of now. I have no postive comment regarding app. It was easy to install at around 120 MB, but pairing with watch is difficult, it takes ages to pair and some time not even pairing even though app detect the watch. Now when it get paired I cant sync any data from watch to mobile. When try to manually sync, its just shows *syncing* but nothing happens. So what use of smart watch if you cant record and sync data?!!!. Another issue with app is downloading watch faces. Only on initial pairing time I was able to download a watch face,(The app shows lot of cool dial faces, but what use if you cant USE them ??)remaining time when i tried in app it just shows *downloading ... 0%*, what nonsense is this, i mean if you are launching a product, make sure atleast it works properly and do what you market it will do.For last one week i tried installing/uninstalling app, restarting mob, pairing/unpairing/forgeting device but data syncing was possible only one time that also for a session. Very bad application/interface/watch firmware or whatever it is.So if you are buying smart watch for logging your activities and monitoring exercise regime, better dont buy this product. You can have a mi band for less price with loaded functions and a smooth application.Customer care: Initially raised a complaint for data syncing inability and what they did was forwarding a technical FAQ link for all their product. Being a tech pro, i had already applied all of their troubleshooting options so i replied that Problem persist, at last a customercare officer called and unfortunately i was entering a lift with boss, so told her to please call after 10 minutes. I tried to call back the number afterwards but it was not connecting. Believe me they called back again but even before ringing, disconnected the call and immediately came an sms stating they were not able to reach my number!!!, literally i was waiting for the call and i saw their number just flashing and disconnecting even before attending the call..!!!, speechless at the customer service of Noise, may be those customer care executives might be getting lots of call as they churn out product after product and people raising complaints after complaints.Winding up: Watch is good looking and smooth, but interface is very very bad coupled with strange customer care response. So buy in your own risk and for those interested in atmnirbar bharath, do check were it is manufactured.Will try to update after 4 weeks or if i get any updates...",2,B097R25DP7,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse,NOISE,SMART WATCH

 23 November 2021,Amazon CustomerAmazon Customer,A good buy. Worth the price.,"For someone looking to buy a SMARTWATCH at a less price and with good features please read my review.  It has been one month of daily use and have had no complaints till now. Although I did face some issues syncing the phone and the watch in the initial few days. But a few restarts did the job. All the features work fine. I have also noticed that whenever there is a delayed alert on the watch it is mostly due to network issues or if the phone is away from the watch. The watch is not to be blamed. At times, I get notifications a sec earlier than the phone. The feature of replying back to calls with template msgs is only available in noise watches I think. I also have a Boat xtend and it only has the feature to reject calls.The green colour is actually a dull green colour so unless you are sure about the colour don't buy a green one since you won't have an option to return it only bcos u don't like the colour. However,  A FEEDBACK FOR THE MAKERS - THERE IS NO REASON WHY NOISE PULSE should HAVE LESS WATCHFACES THAN YOUR OTHER MODELS. Update your user manual and make it easier for those who are using a SMARTWATCH for the first time. Your user manual does not state anything about how to sync it with the phone to get notifications etc. One has to figure it out on the app with trail and error method. It took me a whole day to sync the phone with the watch and figure out what was going wrong.In the end,  No electronic gadget is perfect. If you are looking for something near perfect then buy an Apple watch. Else Noise pulse and similar other models are certainly a good buy.",4,B097R34WKJ,Colour: Teal Green | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse,NOISE,SMART WATCH

Hence, it definately has a good battery life.I've tested the heart rate on non living surface to detect for accuracy and it is quite accurate in detection (did not detect heart rate on non living surface).Although the sleep function don't work regularly in the afternoon i guess but it works fine at night.Rest everything is good.Keep in mind :-It only has call rejection option with a quick reply and not talk via watch or attend call via watch.Same way, it only has option to read messages from notification and not to reply to them.",4,B09PNKXSKF,Colour: Rose Pink | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 30 August 2022,Zoomba,It's okay if you don't have a watch and want one,"- Has all basic features of a digital watch and some more to call it smartwatch.- Touch screen responsiveness is good.- Notifications for selected apps on phone is helpful.- Call reject is also helpful, for example, while driving.- There's no speaker or mic on this watch, so no Bluetooth calling (I didn't want BT calling).- Music controls work with some music apps but I didn't find it good enough to use it often.- Can't say much about accuracy of SpO2 sensor or the heart rate sensor. They do show some data and I am still trying to verify how good that data is.- The step counter is nuts. Not reliable. It overcounts steps.- There's absolutely no storage in this thing for spare watch faces or recording vitals and health data so if you're not connected to the phone, all data is probably getting lost. It does support syncing with Google fit which is reliably picking up data without me fiddling with it.- If you pair with another phone watch face gets reset to default one which is pretty stupid.- It took some getting used to the short screen timeout but I like that it conserves battery and keeps going for a week or more on single charge.- The tilt sensor to turn screen on (the raise to wake thing) is nice and useful.- 4 screen brightness levels are good.- Watch face customisation feature seems like they've played a joke on me. It's crappy. I'd have liked watch face additions on app updates, none so far in about a month of using this.- The strap is holding on good so far. I'd have liked a more skin-friendly strap because I tend to wear it more often than my analog watch.EDIT (06-09-2022):- I recently found that other Noise smartwatches have camera trigger function which is sorely missing from this one.- The sports modes are way too specific and there are only 8 of them; they should have added a generic one for activities not included in the 8 available.Of course now this is also unavailable. Good for you.",3,B097R34WKJ,Colour: Teal Green | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse,NOISE,SMART WATCH

 11 April 2022,AbhijithAbhijith,Best looking smart watch under 2500,"If you're looking for the best Noise smartwatch under 2500, then you should go for Noise caliber. It has better display and has temp sensor.But Noise caliber is kinda big and makes the screen look too small.You should go for Noise ColorFit Grand if you want a normal sized watch. And there is no much of a difference between these watches any way.___________________________________________________________Screen: The screen is pretty good in this watch. The outdoor visibility is fine and it has a really good color reproduction. The touch response is really good comparing to other smartwatches at this price point.Performance: This watch performs really well there is no kind of lag while using this device.Health Tracking: I would say it is fine comparing the price. It is only 2500. There is Heart Rate monitoring, there is no Blood Pressure monitoring but there is SpO2 monitoring provided, Stress monitoring, sleep tracking,60+ workout modes.Heart Rate Monitoring: Works fine 8/10 accuracy compared to a medical equipment. It is fast and can easily show the resultSpo2:  I would say the most accurate feature in this watch. 9.5/10 accuracyStress monitoring: It gives a pretty accurate results. it basically shows your stress levelSleep tracking; i haven't use it yet so, i cant tellWork Out modes: It work! that's all i can say. in a good way though. It just helps you to organise your sport records. For example:- if you playing badminton and you select badminton in Work out mode, it tracks your calories, Max Heart beat, Average Heart Beat, Min Heart beat, Calories burned and workout time.If you cycling and select outdoor cycling in workout mode, it can also track distance and speed. you need to keep you phone with you with GPS turned on btw._______________________________________________________________________________________________|THE HEALTH TRACKING OPTIONS ARE NOT FO REPLACING MEDICAL EQUIPMENTS. SO PLEASE SEE A DOCTOR FOR MEDICAL CHECKUP DO NOT DEPEND OF SMARTWATCHES. SMARTWATCHES ARE NOT A REPLACEMT FOR MEDIACAL EQUIPMENTS. IT ONLY SHOWS YOU AN IDEA ABOUT YOUR HEALTH|_______________________________________________________________________________________________Watch faces: There are 150+ watchfaces you can choose from and you can do it by using Noisefit appBattery: The battery back up is really good and there is an option called battery saving mode which disables notification and lowers the brightness the the lowest setting which can significantly save the battery life.UI: It comes with Noise Colorfit UI. Typical noise UI. It looks great in my opinion. It is really smooth.Build Quality: The build quality is really good. It is not metal but it has really premium touch to it also the curved class. it just makes the watch look premiumWater resistance: it has IP68 water, dust and dirt resistance. I have summerged the watch in water and there is no problem_______________________________________________________________________________________________Overall : It is a really good smart watch and very good looking smartwatch in my opinion. You should go for this watch if you want LOOKS, BETTER DISPLAY, LAG FREE  UI.",5,B09NVPSCQT,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 24 September 2022,Joseph ManojJoseph Manoj,Review after 1 day of use ....,"Watch is pretty good for this discount prices ... Options are nice and by the way some people getting pulses for water bottle please update the watch firmware from noise fit app from playstore, after update and setting health suite works pretty good, like i tested with bottle it asked me to wear the watch properly and didn't gave me a reading... And when i sit calmly it comes around 82 to 87 and when i walk it comes around 102 to 105 which is pretty normal but not accurate, please note that these are not medical equipment to get accurate readings, this thing just give u an idea about your health and set your daily targets in sync with the noise fit appEdit 1 - it's pretty comfortable now couldn't notice the watch in hand unless i see it .... UI is little bit slow but responsive too .... what more could you ask for this price range ....",4,B09NVPSCQT,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 17 August 2022,Milind Shaligram,Overall value for money,"I just bought this phone few days back. It does basic features like steps count ,sleep tracking good. I haven't yet tested calls but sms alerts are good.  I feel wrist band needs to have two sizes small and regular. Current screen is good enough. I don't think so anything more or bigger size is needed.Couple of observations 1. Date needs to be in ddmmmyyyy format for India and not in mmddyyyy fomat. 2. Watch faces must have some bright colors which will show time and steps in those colors even in sunlight. That's viewed max times in this watch. 3. Some basic improvement in reminders...it needs to have repeat option in week ..daily weekly monthly ... 4. Overall watch is good till now and value for money .

 23 August 2022,Piyush,Disappointed,"I'm actually disappointed by the result of this watch, I spent 1 whole day to see youtube videos about this watch and then made the decision to buy it and now when i have it then i can see why it sucks. Quick reply don't work during call, you will be shown quick reply sent but in reality call keeps on ringing in phone. This can be fixed through one simple firmware update but oh well company don't care to fix anything. Secondly find my device is useless, it plays  my phone ringtone for bare 2 seconds and then cut off. How am i gonna find my phone then? Same problem when it comes to finding this watch via noisefit app. This watch only has a vibrating motor that's it. No speaker and noise company expect you to magically find your watch purely on basis of sensing vibration. They literally say ""hear the sound of vibration to find your watch"" 🤦‍♂ thirdly sports mode is actually fake. I was standing still yet it was increasing calories in walking mode. Same happened with other modes as well, it increase calories by assuming that you are actually moving or doing some activity while taking location data from your phone. My phone was still and i was moving with watch on, yet got wrong data on display. Last flaw is sleep tracker it is useless, not accurate at all. It has one thing called REM Rapid eye movement. How are you going to see my eyes with no camera in this watch? How will you identify if i am still awake or asleep? If you have insomnia this watch will assume that you are sleeping cause it's night time. Only benefit of this watch is custom watch face. This you can never get on traditional watches and spo2 and heart rate sensors as well, and stress sensor as well. It is accurate i was having headache and it showed 45 stress level. Yet company labeled it normal till 59 which isn't right.Final thought if you want to measure heart rate, spo2 and stress level along with a waterproof watch then buy it. Otherwise don't fall for 60 sports mode gimmick.",1,B09NVP6HXY,Colour: Olive Green | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH

 29 May 2022,Manoj Jha,Overhyped Smart Watch,"Used Noise ColorFit for about 2 weeks, average watch, but its not at all regular wearing watch. Here is my review for this product:Pros:1. Economical: purchased for Rs. 16992. good in looks3. front face can be customised or different default face can be chosen4. SPO2, Heart Beat, Sleep can be monitoredCons:1. It is not at all an ""all purpose"" watch which you can wear regularly.2. Pin strap system is very very very old and pin was lost within 2 week. now its of no use until you buy new strap .. pins not available in market. It should be pin less technology for straps, else is it not useful for any sports, ride, hiking, trekking or any activity as little pressure on strap and pin breaks out3. in watch face no option to keep it lock with accidental checks, this must be there. Watch should wake up on accidental touch but must be locked or lock screen must be there to use any further section of watch.4. No provision to keep weather on front screen, this is required for travellers, to access this you need to navigate then only you will know about weather5. No sound notification for searching smart watch, if you have kept smart watch and not able to locate it, then from mobile app you can search for watch but it will only vibrate that no very weak vibration, some sound must be there so that it can be tracked easily.6. notification fonts are of "" Baba Adam Era"" very nasty and not at all suitable for reading, they should work on some easy readable fonts.7. Strap quality is smooth but it sticks to skin, so not very skin friendlyNOT at all suitable for Sports, Activities, Riding, or any thing in which there is chance of even little touch on watch.",1,B097R25DP7,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse,NOISE,SMART WATCH

 10 October 2022,AnandAnand,Very good for the price point,"Got it for 1400/-. It has all basic features that you need apart from BT calling.Screen resolution is ok for LCD based screen (considering price).Touch sensitivity is also decent, cannot compare with 3K price ones like Noise Colorfit Pro 4 (Amoled).Screen/Glass gets scratches so keep away from children.IP68 helps to keep it safe from water spills etc.If you are on tight budget go for it. Else, go for little more premium ones like Colorfit Pro 4. I have both so took its example.",4,B09NVPSCQT,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH

 1 January 2022,Unmesh DalviUnmesh Dalvi,Good product. Could be more better.,"The media could not be loaded.  �I brought this product for tracking my distance i walk and run on daily basis. Cost me 1999₹Worked well for couple of days in beginning. Thereafter it had some issues.1.During running in sport mode the watch used to pause automatically in between without any idea.. so i have to check again and again. Or else it indicates less distance then i actually covered.2. Watch started rebooting again and again which erases data and thus bring every count to zero (ref video). Which is frustrating.3. We have to connect to noise mobile app which is easy to connect. But as you go 3-5 mtr away it disconnects so find my phone option becomes useless. Talking about application it is really slow.4. You get about 60 watch faces in mobile app but every time you upload new face to watch which takes 30+ sec to update.. the old one does not get stored in watch so again if you need the old one we have to go back to application to search and change.5. The watch does not lit up quickly by motion sensor, it takes few attempts to lit if the screen. Or other option is buttonGood thing about it is touch which is smooth easy interface. Probably good battery life as i used it of 5 days in one charge still has 45% approx. Light weight. Display quality is also good. Visible in sunlight also.I have asked for replacement, as it has some issues. Will get back soon with updated review.

 8 April 2022,Kindle Customer,Simple watch that ticks most of the boxes,"I was looking for a replacement for my heavy watch and this is a decent Watch that kinda ticks most of the boxes. I wanted a light one, yes this is good. As I have a thin arm, the size is good. ( actually a bit big but it is easier to read messages through this).Quickly the pluses and minuses :Pluses :1. Light2. Easy to set up3. Lovely battery back up - as of now 8th day and going strong 38%4. Alarm works well ( I travel a lot so vibrating alarm is very useful)5. Reading quickly messages , rejecting calls is a boonMinuses :1. Sometimes getting connected to phone can be a challenge2. Watch faces - not so impressive3. American system of month- date can be irritating4.  There is a slight lag before the time comes upbut kinda got used to it. ( pull/ push it up the arm- it works fine) .Havent used it for rides /runs so cant say much about that. HR also has to be checked with the Garmin chest strap / BP monitor ( will do soon).I got it  @ 1990",4,B09NVPSCQT,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse Grand,NOISE,SMART WATCH

 16 June 2022,Gurpreet Singh AroraGurpreet Singh Arora,The Best Budget Watch From Noise !,"So, I am writing the review of this watch after using it for 10 Days. I must say, It’s an excellent product in this price range. The watch is very durable as used with high quality materials. The tracking sensors work fairly well, thou steps sensor counts 8 to 9 steps more, it can be resolved with an update !  Accuracy of this watch is between 80 to 85 percent which is quite fair enough at this price point. I am using it with my iPhone 11 & the app performs really well. The noise app is full of options & watch faces will blow you away thou it takes about a minute to upload a watch face. The app also works seamlessly with Apple Health default app & gives you more information of your tracked data of your entire day activity. Raise to wake feature works perfect & in the end the battery life of watch is really amazing, it gonna last you for at least 4 to 5 days or more when paired with your phone. Till date I have only charged it twice in last 10 days. To sum up, if you want a great quality watch with minimalistic features, Go For It guys ….

 11 September 2021,Muhammad KPMuhammad KP,OK product with bad experience,"Writing a review in detail after using the product for last 1 week, i will be straight as possible.Watch: This is an acceptable product in this price range (bought for 2499/-). Design is smooth, material look durable and good quality. (It seems manufacturer is determined to copy apple watch style). Minimum functions. Sports mode has around 8 options (NO SWIM MODE, even though they boast it is IP68). Screen size is ok with good clarity. Battery seems holding as they claim (I have not activated automatic heart rate monitor, may be thats a reason battery holding).So if you are looking for a show piece or imitating smart watch, this is an ideal choiceApplication (NoiseFit ios variant): Worse than worst mobile app as of now. I have no postive comment regarding app. It was easy to install at around 120 MB, but pairing with watch is difficult, it takes ages to pair and some time not even pairing even though app detect the watch. Now when it get paired I cant sync any data from watch to mobile. When try to manually sync, its just shows *syncing* but nothing happens. So what use of smart watch if you cant record and sync data?!!!. Another issue with app is downloading watch faces. Only on initial pairing time I was able to download a watch face,(The app shows lot of cool dial faces, but what use if you cant USE them ??)remaining time when i tried in app it just shows *downloading ... 0%*, what nonsense is this, i mean if you are launching a product, make sure atleast it works properly and do what you market it will do.For last one week i tried installing/uninstalling app, restarting mob, pairing/unpairing/forgeting device but data syncing was possible only one time that also for a session. Very bad application/interface/watch firmware or whatever it is.So if you are buying smart watch for logging your activities and monitoring exercise regime, better dont buy this product. You can have a mi band for less price with loaded functions and a smooth application.Customer care: Initially raised a complaint for data syncing inability and what they did was forwarding a technical FAQ link for all their product. Being a tech pro, i had already applied all of their troubleshooting options so i replied that Problem persist, at last a customercare officer called and unfortunately i was entering a lift with boss, so told her to please call after 10 minutes. I tried to call back the number afterwards but it was not connecting. Believe me they called back again but even before ringing, disconnected the call and immediately came an sms stating they were not able to reach my number!!!, literally i was waiting for the call and i saw their number just flashing and disconnecting even before attending the call..!!!, speechless at the customer service of Noise, may be those customer care executives might be getting lots of call as they churn out product after product and people raising complaints after complaints.Winding up: Watch is good looking and smooth, but interface is very very bad coupled with strange customer care response. So buy in your own risk and for those interested in atmnirbar bharath, do check were it is manufactured.Will try to update after 4 weeks or if i get any updates...",2,B097R25DP7,Colour: Jet Black | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse,NOISE,SMART WATCH

It has been one month of daily use and have had no complaints till now. Although I did face some issues syncing the phone and the watch in the initial few days. But a few restarts did the job. All the features work fine. I have also noticed that whenever there is a delayed alert on the watch it is mostly due to network issues or if the phone is away from the watch. The watch is not to be blamed. At times, I get notifications a sec earlier than the phone. The feature of replying back to calls with template msgs is only available in noise watches I think. I also have a Boat xtend and it only has the feature to reject calls.The green colour is actually a dull green colour so unless you are sure about the colour don't buy a green one since you won't have an option to return it only bcos u don't like the colour. However,  A FEEDBACK FOR THE MAKERS - THERE IS NO REASON WHY NOISE PULSE should HAVE LESS WATCHFACES THAN YOUR OTHER MODELS. Update your user manual and make it easier for those who are using a SMARTWATCH for the first time. Your user manual does not state anything about how to sync it with the phone to get notifications etc. One has to figure it out on the app with trail and error method. It took me a whole day to sync the phone with the watch and figure out what was going wrong.In the end,  No electronic gadget is perfect. If you are looking for something near perfect then buy an Apple watch. Else Noise pulse and similar other models are certainly a good buy.",4,B097R34WKJ,Colour: Teal Green | Style Name: ColorFit Pulse,NOISE,SMART WATCH

 22 July 2021,Rajib Mitra,Extremely disappointedNot at all worth the hype or your hard earned money,"""The mightiest upgrade"" Lol, what a joke this is!! In no way is this watch even 1% upto the market standards for budget smartwatches.1. It has a laggy UI. So don't assume that since you paying Rs 5000 you'll get a good product. It's the same messed up laggy product rebranded as an upgrade.2. I don't understand why the hell does this watch costs 5000 INR. It's nowhere close to 5000 in terms of worthiness.3. The sensors are definitely not accurate at all. Seems like a computer churning out random results. Post workout, when I definitely know and can feel that my heart rate is high, the watch reading shows 77, which should have been a reading corresponding to complete idleness.The SpO2 sensor is a big spoof as well.4. The biggest problem I was faced the huge lag in call notifications. At times, I used to get notifications on my watch only after my whole call was complete. And in general, there is always a big old lag of 10 seconds on average.5. Why did they even bother of putting camera control? You don't have any specific app for it. You need to go to the noisefit app, open a camera feature through the app which won't allow you to use any of the camera features, abd then ask you to shake your wrist to click a picture. You will keep shaking your wrist until it starts to pain for the camera shutter to respond. So another gimmick by noise.6. The app is also not at all fine tuned and it's always syncing even though it's always running in the background eating up your mobile's battery.Now even despite facing these issues, I went for a replacement. But again, even the replacement watch had the exactly same issues as the previous one which assures me that the whole ""Colorfit Ultra"" segment is a complete gimmick.So, the only purpose this watch serves is showing you the time. And spending Rs 5000 just for that on a so called ""smartwatch"" is a fancy way to waste your money. Instead spend your hard earned money on a traditional watch. If you want to spend 5000 on a watch, better go for a Edifice, and not this watch.",1,B093HCLPJ5,Colour: Gunmetal Grey | Style Name: ColorFit Ultra,NOISE,SMART WATCH

 21 July 2021,Ajit,Complete review of a Smartwatch,"TLDR : Do not buy this. ❌❌❌for 4.5kRs 4,500 .... IS TOO MUCH to spend for this expensive toy.Its just a fitness band with a large big display most pros you would find in a good fitness band.PROS :1. Claimed 1.75"" display is excellent. (near AMOLED Quality) .. this is only reason why I opted for this. Brightness is of acceptable level. One can read fonts in daylight with proper watch faces.2. Some measurements are good, E.g Heart Rate, Oxygen SpO2 and somewhat sleep measurement.3. Some features are welcome, E.g. Drink water reminder, idle time reminder etc.4. Build of the device is good.  Straps are holding on good. Watch has a nice heft to it. Oleophobic coating is holding on.CONS :1. Chinese company masquerading as Indian brand (period)2. BIGGEST CON, is the Noise Fit APP ... You need it to even BOOT the watch the first time.App asking too many permissions, requires location and Network even if you want to open and see the stats. Started getting marketing calls + whatsapp messages from Chinese numbers (Coincidence??)There is no Exit for this Noisefit crApp ... you will have to go to settings and kill it.3. Battery backup unpredictable. anything from 2 to 4 days. I only have idle time alert on.Tried everything like Watch in Aeroplane mode, Brightness kept to minimum, continuous heart rate monitor, reminder to drink etc etc are all off DND on etc etcFinally I believe I got a watch face that is holding a steady charge of at least 3.5 days4. Inaccurate calculations, Shows step counts, before I have even woken up. Awake times are not accounted for, in sleep calculations. Inaccurate step / distance count (upto 30% off. 2km walk shows as 1.4 kms etc)Just an expensive toy that's all. I would say, fitness band is better value for money.5. Very complex menus and the switch is designed too low, towards the wrist, difficult to press. Selecting a workout in itself is a workout.6. Flimsy charging chord, may break at any moment. Magnetic not holding up as strong.7. The fancy stuffs like watch faces are not up to expectations. For a start, you can load only one watch face from the app, the rest you will have to be contended with your 5 watch faces that comes with the device.OVERALLWas waiting for a big screen device. Though 4.5k is too much, this was a gift and so went for it.BIG NEGATIVE is the NOSE👃🏻FIT app, asking for Location permissions and Internet connection for using the app.These companies shouldn't force us giving our information. RATED 1 STAR for your app.",2,B093HCLPJ5,Colour: Gunmetal Grey | Style Name: ColorFit Ultra,NOISE,SMART WATCH

Not as smooth UI as amazefit.Battery 2/5 I does not even last 2 days and that too when I have switched off continuous heart rate monitor, and phone is not always connected with watch.

 15 September 2021,SAURABH KUMAR GARGSAURABH KUMAR GARG,Ok for a watch not so smart and flimsy strap,"I got the product on 14th Sep and here is my feedback after 2 weeks:1. Build quality - Metal Watch unit is really good with a big screen2. Wrist band - Is Silicone and very flimsy and thin. It feels sticky and as you can see from the picture since I have a hairy hand, its pulling my hairs and takes a good 15 seconds to put on. I recommend buying a Nylon Soft loop band along with the watch.3. The APP is good and the pairing process with the watch was simple and seamless, but that's about it. The app is good for nothing after the initial pairing. It just does not work !!4. Downloading watch faces - It just does not work (Or at-least for me it does not). Initially it was taking a good 1 Minute for each watch face but after the first firmware update it has stopped working (See the third screenshot). The APP gets hung when I try to update a watch face.5. The SPO2 monitor appears in the menu when you press the physical button on the watch is not there when swipe the screen left where all the other options like Music, Sleep, Breathe, Stress, Heartrate and Activity are there. Noise forgot to add SPO2 there. Although not a problem but an additional step6. Its only IP67 so you cannot go underwater only splash proof7. Although company claims battery will last 9 days, but I Observed that the battery lasts on an average for about 7 Days and that too with no active features like continuous heart rate monitoring, Notification etc.8. The charging cable is sub-standard and I just hope that it lasts long, the wire is thin and I believe if the charging port was a square one like the one that comes with other watches, it would have been better.9. And yes the customer care doesn't care, If you try to reach them they send you a pre set message to try to resolve issue which is of no use.Hope prospective buyers read this review and stay away from this product for now and save their hard earned money, at-least till these issues are fixed for good by the company.",1,B094JB13XL,Colour: Space Blue | Style Name: ColorFit Ultra,NOISE,SMART WATCH

And all these are happening after latest update of the app on my phone. Already there were gimmicky features like music control. It doesn't work at all. The 'find my phone' feature was also not working. At this moment my watch has got switched off by itself. Its not starting anymore. Very disappointed with noise. Won't buy anything from noise in the future. I bought this product out of sentiment after learning that it's an Indian product. I guess i was wrong. I have wasted 4500/.

 20 May 2022,Amazon Customer,Noise doesn't have the option of after-sales service. Please buy at your own risk.,"Please read my below mail before buying Noise Product.I am not sure if you will suffer or not but I am suffering for the past 20 days.Till today there is no solution to the issue and still, the watch is in the service center.Dear Team,This is Mahipal Singh Gehlot. I purchased Noise Color-fit Ultra Smart Watch from Amazon on 26/04/22 and it was delivered to me on 27/04/22.After using it for just a couple of days, I started facing LCD LINE ISSUE on 07/05/22 and submitted it to the nearest service center on 11/05/22 (Job No. : RVSRN220511DTS0107). It's about been 10 days since I had given it for service and I have not received it back from service yet. Initially, they told me that I would get the watch back within 10 days, now when I had called to check the status of my watch, one of the service representatives answered my call (after me calling their SOS number multiple times) he informed me that- "" it would take more 5-7 days and if I needed an early service, he would just return the watch without repairing it"".Please tell me, is this the way your team behaves with the customer. Since day one, the service representative has been talking to me in a rude & harsh manner.Now, I didn't mind the initial delay, because I understand the limitations each service center faces concerning equipment and spares, but to handle the customer in the wrong way is something I cannot sit and watch especially when I am at the receiving end.Before purchasing this watch, I was thinking of going with the Fastrack brand based on their goodwill and service provided by them but I still went NOISE thinking I will receive the same at the NOISE service center but seems like I am wrong to think that.To conclude this email, firstly, I would like you to kindly help me to speak to the Service Head for Customer Queries at Noise. Second, I would like my watch to be replaced by Noise, with a full warranty.If you are unable to fulfill both of my resolutions, kindly let me know the same through this email thread.Also, please note, that the purchase bills, the service bill, job card number, and everything related to the watch & the issue with the watch, will be uploaded on social media, tagging NOISE to let the potential customers know about the negligence that the brand does to their customer.",1,B093HCLPJ5,Colour: Gunmetal Grey | Style Name: ColorFit Ultra,NOISE,SMART WATCH

However don't except it to be accurate as iwatchI got this watch at 3.5k.Pros:* Great display quality, it have a brightness adjustment. Even I kept it low and was quite visit in good sunlight.* Comfortable in wearing for a longer duration* Plenty of sports modes. Most of all the relevant sports modes are covered in the activitie tracker list.* Decent battery life. It can easily give you 7 days of battery backup up. There is a DND mode which can restrict from showing the notifications frequently and eat up your battery.* Big screen size. Even though the screen size is much bigger to the other trackers in this range, the size of the dial is good enough.*Step counting is accurate.Con:* You can only be able to receive notifications from the apps that is available in the list* I am not able to few the full content of the notification received. There are character limits in the notification* The mobile is not up to the mark. There are plenty of bugs which need to be rectified.* In the watch you can store 5 watch faces at time which can be swapped without the mobile app. But in them only one you are able to modify other 4 are predefined and can't be changed.*You don't have the option to save multiple watch faces on the device. Everytime you want to change it, you need to go to the app and change which is time consuming and irritating !*Battery backup will not last more for than 48hrs if you power on notification than you have to charge twice a day* 1.75' display isn't suitable for people with thin hand mostly women.* No microphone to receive calls.

 10 August 2021,Mithilesh Pandey,Worst purchase for a Smart watch,"I have purchased two watches. I generally don't write reviews until I find the best or the worst thing. This is a honest review after 1 month of use of both the watches I purchased.1. Worst battery. Will not last even 3 days if you are regular user and moderate health activities.2. The accuracy of the data is not good. So calories, distance traveled, step count etc is tentative in nature.3. No sync between your activities data and the general data hence if you work out for some time in a day and your other daily routine data will be shown separately and you cannot make a inference of combined data.4. Software glitches which makes the experience worse.5. High price.. At this price there are much better options with built in GPS.6. Only pros is the screen size.This was my first purchase of Noisefit and honestly this is my last one also if I don't hear from the customer care for giving me a solution to the above mentioned issues.",1,B093HCLPJ5,Colour: Gunmetal Grey | Style Name: ColorFit Ultra,NOISE,SMART WATCH

 1 August 2021,Amazon CustomerAmazon Customer,Value for Monday,"Overall the watch is good. I had a Noice Colorfit 2, had few scraches on the screen and wanted a replacement.Pro1. Compared to other watches in the market this watch comes in a good price range.2. Its loaded with features - sleep tracking, oxygen level, heart rate etc.3. There are many options to change the watch faces. This is really fun, had changed 10 faces in last 10 days.4. Good battery backup. Lasts more than a week right now.5. Display is big, compared to the older model.Cons1. The oxygen level measurement is not accurate. I tried with a oxymeter and the value shown in a oxymeter is different than that shown in watch. Also it varies based on where you are wearing the watch and how tight it is fitted.2. The heart rate measurement also varies a bit. I have compared with wearing a BP machine at the same time.3. The app is glitchy. Once I lost full day data due to my watch restarting or something like that. When I tried synchiing it again it lost all my previous data.4. Sometimes i dont get notifications on my watch.5. The screen is not scratchproof. Since I am not able to find a decent screen guard, the only option will be to replace this watch over 6-8 months.6. It is difficult to get a stress measurement.Overall, its value for money. Dont expect Apple watch kind of features and stability in this device. Something you can hang on to for 6-8 months.",4,B093HCLPJ5,Colour: Gunmetal Grey | Style Name: ColorFit Ultra,NOISE,SMART WATCH

It looks very premium and stylish.* Watch faces are cool looking.* The display is quite impressive as compared to other watches.* The touch screen works fine.Cons :* 1.75' display isn't suitable for people with thin hand mostly women.* Sensors are not very accurate.* I didn't get a battery life of more then 4days. Whereas the brand claims to be of 9days battery life.* The watch is slow while syncing a Watch face from phone.*  No microphone to receive calls. You can only reject a call.* You can't reply to text message. Only predefined message can be sent.If you are looking for a premium looking watch Noise Colorfit Ultra is a wonderful choice.

It's got delivered to my home in just 1day. That's Impressive (Amazon). Well now on the 1st day of using this watch, falls me totally in love with the very large display. But i noticed that some issues are there with the watch. But maybe that I can't operate it correctly or idk, so i ignored. Now i am using this for past 6days and now i got that, what i expect from this watch. Below are the experience of mine..Pros-Big 1.75inch display + It's Activity Tracking + The Health monitoring features +Build quality + Battery life (10Days) without 24/7 heart rate monitoring and (6-7Days)with it.Cons-It's slow touch response + The watch faces.Overall it's definitely a very good Product to buy, and it's totally value for money and highly recommended to buy it....  so guys go for it❤️  ❤️  - Thanks Noise for this amazing product.",5,B093HCLPJ5,Colour: Gunmetal Grey | Style Name: ColorFit Ultra,NOISE,SMART WATCH

 12 October 2021,EcmaScript HackerEcmaScript Hacker,"It smells like cheap, cancerous plastic.","It has plastic straps, cheap plastic straps. The watch smells so bad that I cannot bring it near my mouth. There goes comfort of wearing it while sleeping.But the concern I have is cheap plastic. As you know cheap plastic degrades faster and breaks into micro particles frequently. These micro particles can be inhaled or swallowed, and may in future cause cancer.Just 5 minutes after washing and drying it, weird white particles appear on the strap again. Plastic is literally shedding itself.There is no refund. This is a cash grab from an Indian company. Don't go for it. I only bought because of advertising and it is false. Chinese products are superior to this garbage.Did I say hot garbage? Oh yeah, the app cooks your phone in minutes. I have never seen my phone this hot.

 23 July 2021,Arun ThalapathiArun Thalapathi,DISAPPOINTED !,"I bought the watch on the launch day hoping that the additional features would be a good deal after the positive reviews of colour fit Pro 3 only to be DISAPPOINTED !!Below is my detailed review after using it for 6 days:Pro's :1. The larger screen size and display quality is good. The aluminium body gives it a premium look until you start using it regularly.2. Decent range of watchfaces (around 100) to choose from.Con's :1. The app is full of bug's. In the screenshot attached, you can see that after my workout the data in the activity is available but the step count and the other data suddenly went to zero and all the data just got reset to zero for some reason.2. The wrist sense is pathetic. Whenever I want to look at the time after a while, I have to move my wrist multiple times or press the button on the watch for the display to be visible inspite of the 'wrist awake ' feature being switched on.3. The battery is not as good as they claim to be. It would last for a week at max. inspite of the 300 mah battery.4. You don't have the option to save multiple watch faces on the device. Everytime you want to change it, you need to go to the app and change which is time consuming and irritating !5. The step count is not 100 % accurate. I tested it multiple times and there is a 10%  error in the number shown.6. For a device which has 60 sports modes,Tennis is not included.To summarise, don't waste your money on this and explore other options available !",2,B094JCKPM6,Colour: Cloud Grey | Style Name: ColorFit Ultra,NOISE,SMART WATCH
 21 July 2021,Anirban Ghosh,"Activity tracking is more important which Noise Colorfit Ultra lacks, lookwise it is very good.","Lookwise it's good. Perfect size and design. Display is also good. Strap quality is good. But in case of features it is not good. It doesn't have any countdown timer which is an important feature needed in case of workout. Also the sleep tracking is not accurate. It cannot track awake time accurately. It cannot track outdoor activities like outdoor running, outdoor cycling accurately since it doesn't sync with phone's gps. The results are very inaccurate. I travelled 8 Kms while cycling and it shows only 0.28 Km with an average speed of 0.64 Km/ hour whereas my Amazefit Bip U records 7.9 Km with an average speed of 15-20 Kms / hour which is very accurate. Amazefit tracks accurately since it syncs with phones's gps.

Below is my review after 3 weeks of usage:1. Got it for 4.5k as launch discount. Budget option2. Display is large and quality is good3. Call disconnect and preloaded replies are good4. Music contol from my watch is really cool5. Step counter and sleep tracking is ok. Not 100% accurate thoughCons:1. Brezel are too big.2. Not sleek and looks large if wrist is not thick3. Step count accuracy is not very good. But managable4. Wake up sensor is not good. Sometime screen doesn come after turning wrist. Seems frustating sometime5. Missing gps6. Bigger msg come as different notification in watch7. Msg read in watch remain unread on phone and reappear later8. Doesnt sych with google fit. Seems some issue.Overall verdict: if you have tight budget and want larger screen this is best.

Still not getting call Notifications😪2> Take too much time to pair. Minimum 1-2min or maximum infinity 😴3> When we try to pair this watch to another mobile phone then we have to reset it and then it can connect sometimes.👎4> when you focus on the screen it looks a little bit tilted or the screen is not in the centre and that looks like the display is not properly designed.Suggestion - Go for Realme watch 2 pro or Any other brands rather than these nonsense Noise watchesPlease don't buy this watch. 😭save your moneyAs compared to Realme Watches, Noise fails at every level. I used Noise Colorfit pro 3 and Ultra also and Realme Watch but Realme takes only 1-2 sec to pair and noise takes a minimum of 1-2 minutes. OS of Realme is very smooth.

 23 July 2021,Shiva Kumar Shiva Kumar ,"Worst smart watch (delay in notifications ""calls/msgs"" & less accuracy)",I have been using smart bands (MI & honor band 5) since 5 years. This is the worst smart watch. I have took this on release date and there will no reviews yet.I took this just because of positive response from colleague's and this watch looks very premium and will suit for broad wrist. Below are the issues:1. Delay in getting notifications. Sometimes after answering call it is getting call notification on smart watch. Some times even after I ended call. This is very horrible.2. Application is well graphical but if I want to time am awake in middle I cannot see. It just gives brief and dashboard of sleep.3. Stress is not getting synch with app.Don't know whether this can be resolved in updates.I don't feel 4500 is valued for this 😕,1,B094JCKPM6,Colour: Cloud Grey | Style Name: ColorFit Ultra,NOISE,SMART WATCH

Sleep tracker start and end timings are not correct, stay awake inbetween always show as 0 even when i moved around for more than 5 minutes. The readings of steps keeps resetting to 0 at random intervals one or two times a day and there were days when it was not reset. No data submitted by the app to google fit eventhough both are linked. The query raised and assistance sought is not yet addressed (morethan a week) to and there is no direct assistance like live chat or call. As the watch is not returnable and only replaceable in retun window, I am keeping it as someone told thst the replacement got is having more problems than the original.

 9 August 2022,MH,Good build quality & display. But not very smart.,"Skipping the parts mostly covered in other reviews and sponsored yt ones, I will add few irritants and common sense disappointments I noticed since last few days of actual usage of this NOT so smart watch:1.AOD do not show date & day of week. Only shows hour and mins. No way to configure it beyond analog/digital view. It also gets turned off when you start any exercise activity like walking. So the screen goes dark when you go for a walk!2. Calory count on home screen or anywhere else only shows step counts calories but not an aggregate calories burnt through exercise activities. I.e if step cals = 100 and cycling = 90 then it will only show 100 on home screen and separate two entries in app. Its not smart enough to do the addition.3. No quick way to go to and start the activity/exercise. First press side button twice then select activites list from menu. Versus Swipe up from home screen goes to utterly useless cricket score screen instead which many even won't use. No customisation of these menu options to functionality mapping provided.4. There is no touch to wake display available on screen. This is available on my 1800 rupee, 3 yr old huwai band 4! One has to press the side button every time just to see the home screen,which is utterly inconvenient to reach to.5. There is no day/night time auto on/off configuration of AOD or 'twist to wake' provided making it irritating during sleep hours if kept on. Thus daily two times a day its a task to enable/disable these features manually.Every freaking day!Kindly also note that there is indication, whatsoever, on AOD about the started exercise activity! So you start one, like outside walking, come home, and then after two hours discover you forgot to turn it off when you press the side button to activate the watch face screen!6. Unable to detect 20/30  mins power naps during the day time and add it to total 24 hr sleep tally. Only counts night time sleep hours that too with the average accuracy. As said before, not smart enough to do the simple math!7. Charging is fast but with even the AOD and BT calling disabled battery drains considerably in a day. Magnetic charger has its own down side e.g. gets disengaged at a minor twist tension on the charging cable.8. For activating the weather and cricket score features, user has to accept some opaque and unknown 3rd party (separate from Boat OEM opaque data privacy ones ) end user data usage policies. Without enabling GPS and/or contact/call logs access to mobile app none of these two features work. Which is very suspicious given their intended usage. Feb 23: After recent firmware update, now just to sync the data the mbl app needs gps turned on! O.w. it doesn't 'connect' to the watch over Bluetooth!9. If you remove the watch from the wrist and keep it aside, it keeps auto counting the heart rate and adds that lower count to average heart rate statistics! So to say it doesn't count the things to count and keeps counting the things not to count!10. Since installing the mobile app 'cove' I am observing rapid battery drain despite of restricting all the permissions and keeping bluetooth off. The bluetooth and sound level control functions of the phone are also randomly impaired for some unknown reasons and need phone restart to resolve.11. Sedentary remider most of the times do not get triggered when you are stationary but is notified after you start moving around!12. Cove App pushed firmware update completely wiped off all watch device setting preferences and resetting watch to all default settings, including the watch face, AOD, brightness level! The update also creepily asks to enable the gps without which it do not proceed! Now why does firmware update needs GPS??Its obvious that most of above issues/limitations can be easily fixed by software fixes and updates. But real question is do these so called dozens of smart watch chinese clone companies bother to give that much attention to details? And we know unfortunate answer to that question.",3,B0B573ZK1H,Colour: Deep Blue | Style Name: BT Calling+AMOLED | Pattern Name: boAt Xtend Pro,BOAT,SMART WATCH
 26 August 2022,Anjana KumariAnjana Kumari,Worth the price!,"The media could not be loaded. Got this watch just today and checked all the features one by one. Download Boat Crest� app for pairing this.SpO2: Measurement time is only 5-8sHeart Rate: Takes quite some timeLive Score: Live score of a sport can be enabled from the appBluetooth Calling: BT works great! You can use the dialer to call manually, or sync contacts from your phone and call from the phonebook. The microphone works fine when the proximity level of your mouth and the watch is around 10-15cm; far from that, the other person might face a difficulty in hearing your voice. The speaker is very impressive as the sound in crystal clear without any echo or lag. Overall, the calling feature is a 10/10!Steps Recorder: The step count is pretty accurate; can record 90-95 steps of the 100 you walk.Notifications: Shows notif info upto 4-5 lines. Notifications of only Facebook, WhatsApp and E-mail can be received and no other apps. This is one demerit I found in this watch which needs to be fixed and the provision to enable notifs for as much apps as we want should be made.Timer: Has default timers of 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes respectively. Custom timer provision is also there.Flashlight: A very bright, white background comes on the interface when you click on the flashlight option. It's definitely not as effective as a phone's flash, but works fine.Alarm: You can set as many alarms as you want.Weather: Don't know what's the problem but I'm unable to see the weather info on my watch. Tried pairing-unpairing, turning on and off the weather settings but nothing worked.Battery: Got the watch with 61% battery and it's been 5-6 hours since I'm using this with 5-6 times bluetooth calling upto 15s average time per call and it's still 57%! The battery life, I must say, till now is impressive!Other features like camera control, music control are also good. Features like voice assistant and find phone are useful.Overall, this watch with such a vaste range of features in 4K is a great, and a deal worth the price. Some things like the weather info, better customisation of watch faces, more app notifs receival should be looked into and made better.I'd rate this watch 8/10 for now and will keep editing this review it I find any difficulties in the near future.",4,B0B574QXFL,Colour: Active Black | Style Name: BT Calling+AMOLED | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,BOAT,SMART WATCH
 17 October 2022,rakesh kanurakesh kanu,Ita is an ok product....better to buy a good fitbit or samsung or apple watch.,"The media could not be loaded. Hello Good Day,I'm a fan of boat device and I recently purchased a Smart watch of your brand and thought to put a feedback on how it can be improved if possible via software update.VOLUME1. I should be able to increase or decrease the call notifications of my smart watch which I'm unable to find any settings either on watch or in the appFIND MY PHONE2. The option to find my watch in the app is of no use if it's gonna just vibrate instead of using its speaker for better locating.WATCH ROTATING DIAL3. the dial of the watch rotates right ? So does that have any purpose of rotating and scrolling options ? if not then a button would a better optionNOTIFICATION4. Adding more app options in the notification section where only 5 to 6 only available out of other apps that I'm using.CALL DISPLAY OPTION5. during call when i'm on call the display is always on and displaying to whomever ever im speaking to while i'm on my phone. getting notification on watch is fine but after few seconds display should not be on continuously as i'm nearly 15 to 20 minutes on call and don't want my watch battery to drain unnecessarily. and also don't want anyone to see whom i'm speaking to as i'm left handed and i pick my calls through my left hand most of the time. where in other can see with whom I'm speaking. 2  to 3 seconds is more than enough rather than through the call.....AUDIO DIVERT6. If i pick my phone through my phone then the voice of the calls should be audible through phone only otherwise what the use of picking up my calls through phone and audio comes from the watch...if i answer my call through my watch then its an ideal time to divert my audio of the call through the watch. otherwise it makes no sense.WATCH FACES7. Most of the watch faces looks outdated to me. seems using other old face watch themes....this is amoled display...please provide for such a good display some good face watch or add an option where a user can customise them according their needs. and also provide new face watch option for always on display too....there is so much things can be done.NUDGE OPTION8. what is the use of this optionsNOTIFICATION PANEL9. I get notifications of respective apps is fine but once I have Attended or removed notifications from my phone notification then it should also get removed from my watch notification panels as well. staying there and manually removing from both devices is  not a smart way to remove notification.It's a smartwatch right ?STRESS SENSOR AND ENERGY METER10 . How do you calculate Stress and energy of the person, any logical reasons to consider or its just for show ? FITNESS PLAN.11. I want to gain weight and all it tells me to do is run... How does this make any sense?  Running is not going to help me gain weight... and if it's not for me then dp provides one or else it's of no use for the customer like me who are buying such watches and it makes no use for them. best is to remove that option.12. SLEEP TRACKING.it only tracks night sleeping time...but does not tracks afternoon or whichever other time i sleep..it should know that I'm sleeing whenever I'm sleeoing.13. ALWAYS ON DISPLAYits of no use...and cant change the dial theme of this settings....",3,B0B574QXFL,Colour: Active Black | Style Name: BT Calling+AMOLED | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,BOAT,SMART WATCH

 15 November 2022,Ankit SharmaAnkit Sharma,All good except for few things,"What all is good you can know from other comments and youtube.Lets come to the Cons1. Once you have connected bluetooth calling, even if you pickup your calls through phone, it'll automatically get transfered to the watch which is a bit annoying.However  once u have answered the call you get a option on watch to transfer the call to the phone.2. There's no option to silent the call notification on your watch. Either you put it on DND mode in which case you will get no notification on your watch or else your watch will ring once you have a phone call.However, u can mute the ring tone once it starts ringing by pressing the crown button.3. The alarm provided is not of much importance as it only vibrates softly for only 10 seconds. It does'nt rings at all. Neither I found any setting to make it ring.If anyone can make it ring please let me know.4. Sleep tracker doesnt works well. Last night I slept for 11 hours but it shows only 6.5 hours.5. The option to find my watch in the app is of no use if it's gonna just vibrate instead of using its speaker for better locating.6. Day and date is not shown in AOD feature7. Day is missing in customised faces. Only time and date is shown8. Double tap to wake and sleep feature if present could have made the watch more useful.This is all what I noticed after using the watch for a day.",4,B0B574QXFL,Colour: Active Black | Style Name: BT Calling+AMOLED | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,BOAT,SMART WATCH

 7 August 2022,Nilanko Halder,"Highly overrated, not worth it seriously","The media could not be loaded. Trust me, this product is bad. Don't believe the YouTube reviews, they are mostly paid and fake reviews.Nearly everything about this device is bad:1. Touch response is terrible. You have to try 2-3 times for touch swiping to work.2. Laggy display. Although the refresh rate is 60Hz, the FPS is barely 20fps. There is no smoothness. Other local brands have better smoothness at this price point.3. Vertical sync issue. There's no vertical synchronisation in the display -- you'll keep experiencing screen tearing which looks terrible.4. Steps counter and all such stuff is inaccurate. I was lying on bed and it counted 34 steps just like that. Sleep tracking is the worst I've ever seen. My phone tracks better sleep which I can't even ""wear"".5. The 100+ watch faces are all pathetic as well. Very simple minimalistic, look like created in MS Paint. Most of them won't show details other than time and date. There are no customisation options for custom watch face either - it looks hideous as well.6. App issues. Functions don't work here and there, for example the weather won't update and will show empty even if you enable it.7. Notifications only from a limited number of apps (4-5).CHECK OUT THE VIDEO WHERE I'VE SHOWN HOW TERRIBLE THE TOUCH RESPONSE IS.PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS DEVICE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY.

 1 August 2022,Anonymous Anonymous ,Good enough at this price range,"Pros:The Amoled display and the multitude of watch faces are great. The Bluetooth calling feature along with the mic and speakers are excellent.Female well being option along with other activities that can be tracked are commendable.Battery life is good.Wake up gesture is good, as an alternative of tap to wake.Cons:There are issues with weather and social media/sms notification features does not sync. Needs firmware patch upgrades.Also, the cricket score feature is not as useful, considering I am not a cricket fan, however could be worth for a fanatic.It detects heartbeat even when the watch is simply lying on the table.To access the system and call functions, a swipe right would be more useful than having to frequently use of the button. Instead of having the same series of options on swipe left / right.The Bluetooth calling feature disconnects fast - it doesn't show on phone even when connected.Even though I have set the sleep time to 15 seconds, the watch sleeps eithin the default 5 seconds.",4,B0B5772V6B,Colour: Raging Red | Style Name: BT Calling+AMOLED | Pattern Name: boAt Xtend Pro,BOAT,SMART WATCH

It looks great on the hand.Question: What did I not like about Boat Xtend Pro?Answer: Again, the strap. I purchased this for my wife, and she has a flimsy wrist. The metal strap holds itself via a magnetic lock. However, even after stretching it to the max extent, it was still lose on her wrist. So this product is not meant for people with thin wrists.Question: Is it for a thick wrist person?Answer: Maybe. I tried it on my hands, and i somehow did not feel confident enough that the magnetic strap will not give in when I shake my hand hard enough.Question: What about the other features?Answer: Don't know.

 8 August 2022,Rounak Bhattacharyya,Not value for money as it has bugs. Only good screen,Pros:Good BT calling watch.Amoled screen is good quality.Cons:Accuracy needs to be improved.Weather feature was not working(update-working now).Major bug- no option to set call alert to only vibrate without ringtone. It will always start make the irritating ringing sound whenever there is an incoming call and we have to manually silent it. It is really disturbing as you don't want everyone everytime around to know that you are receiving a call. This bug hits the BT calling purpose of the watch badly.Needs more watch faces specially analog ones.Mobile App needs to be improved.Did not expect another cheap knockoff that too with bugs from Boat.

As per my point of view, it's a worth buying product for  2999 if you have any creadit card discount or any extra offer you can buy for less than Rs.2500.Pros.* Call functionality works great. Clear audio in Mike as well as in loudspeaker.* Looks is another plus point. It looks elegant and descent in your hands...1.78"" AMOLED Display looks cool...*Sports mode works pretty wellCons.*Watch call ring sound is as loud as your phone. Sometimes it feels irritating. And you don't have an option to reduce the phone ring volume.*Each time when you open the Crest app..Syncing need to be done..sometimes it take around 40s minut, which is actually slow.Overall I would suggest you to buy this one of you are looking for a mid range watch with best calling fecility.

 24 November 2022,Shahed,Good but could have been better for a RS 3500 price,"Pros:1. Amoled Display is super, usable at very low or low brightness level. TFT and LCD watches looks terrible after using this.2. Touch Response is good.3. Speaker sound and quality is good for calling and music.4. Steps counter looks correct, can't say accurate.5. ASAP charge is real, other devices are very slow compared to this.6. Fonts and icons are nice,i have seen some watches with very bad color fonts and layout.Cons:1.Watch speaker will be selected by default when you accept a call from mobile too, which is annoying.it should only use it if the call is accepted from the watch.2. Whether location is not accurate, may be app problem.3. Steps history in watch has a view of 1 week but only show current day details, whereas sleep data of mon to sun can be seen.4. Not sure if BPM and SP02 are accurate.5. It has a speaker but alarm don't have any sound only vibrates ��6. 1 biggest missing i feel is, it doesn't automatically identifies our activity like walking/running/activities, it only calculates total steps. For each modes we need to select the type of activity manually which is plenty of available.7. Steps are not syncing with Google fit, sleep and bpm syncs fine.Concl:There are lots of good features in watch but the app or software is not utilising it 100%, most of the  issues can be solved by software update i hope so.I would say don't buy for RS 3500 If these issues are solved. May be worth 2500 to 3000 range because above 3500 you can get other good brands too.

I am stating this after 4 battery charge cycles,It's been 7 days since I made this purchase.Even without BT calling feature on ideal conditions without AOD 20 to 23% battery drops in 24 hours.Battery backup could be much better.Issues:-1:-We do not have volume control in watch.While making a call via watch, meanwhile the callertune is ringing we cannot control the volume, which seems annoying at times,You can only control the volume when your call is pickedup by the other person.Also, there is no volume control in general settings.2:-While BT calling is not active app shows your watch is ready to receive calls,But in reality you can only reject the calls and send auto replys, you can not receive callYou can only receive the calls when using BT calling feature is active.3:-While BT calling is active if you play music using music app on watch, audio play back wiil be on watch speaker, now there is no option to transfer the audio back to the phone speaker,For that you have to go to mobile sound settings manually and select playback output as phone speaker,But while BT calling we have this option of transferring audio from watch speaker to phone.4:-We have the option to collect the heart rate and show and show Reading automatically after a specific time span may be after every 10 min.Sometimes it doesn't work well.",3,B0B574QXFL,Colour: Active Black | Style Name: BT Calling+AMOLED | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,BOAT,SMART WATCH

Bluetooth Calling & NotificationI have used this feature, and I can say that this watch performs very well in terms of the Bluetooth calling feature. The speakers are loud so that you will not have any problem hearing the sound, I have made calls from it even in outdoor conditions, and I got to see great results.Overall, I got it in a special prime deal and it is one of the best products in the market.

( Their biggest mistake ) 10/10 for thisOn day one : out of the box , the watch was showing an inaccuracy by margin of 20% in sleep tracking, 10% inaccuracy in pedometer and a negligible 3 or 5 BPM up or down when compared to oximeter ( with the white sticker peel attached to the sensors). I used it like this for 3 days.On the 3rd day is when all went sideways, i decided to peel the white sticker off and see for myself whether the inaccuracy issue could be resolved to a Margin but surprisingly, it did not happen to the case. The heart rate accuracy improved to 99% while, accuracy of all the other measurements except spo2 went down by a significant margin at just above 25% which is the worst I've seen on any smartwatch with that being said it was better off with the white stickers attach to the sensor. ( Weird right ? ) . ( I slept for 8 hours and it showed 2:30 hours and walked 97 steps in my sleep ��, i cooked some food in the kitchen and it showed I walked for about 2500 steps  ).About weather : the bug of broken weather forecast has been fixed and it good to go. 10/10Display : best in the segment , unique 60hz amoled offering. 10/10.Build : 9/10 , 1 less for the okeish quality of the stock strap.Both storm pro and xtend pro are made in india.( Xtend pro is more bugless than storm ).Update on 14th August  : went ahead with a replacement. Let's see if it fixes my glitches or not. ( Will update afterwards )Update on August 30th - After replacing the accuracy seems more apt to my taste. Got the second firmware update of version .41 , it has bought an addition of 10 new wallpaper ( useful ones ) , while other waste ones still remain at the larger side and I do not why the app works flawlessly with Android 12 whereas on Android 10 is unbearable.",3,B0B574QXFL,Colour: Active Black | Style Name: BT Calling+AMOLED | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,BOAT,SMART WATCH

However, it still has some difficulty in Bluetooth connectivity and does disconnect at random intervals. Xtend Pro needs a firmware upgrade to fix these issues.The Boat app needs to be always running in background for the watch to remain connected so you will have to lock the app from being killed in Android and enable Auto Start.The Battery life is Awesome and easily comes to 10-12 days without Bluetooth Calling & Always On display. However you could enable just call & sms notification which will be helpful rather not having the watch Ring.However, I had to return the watch due to Home Button issues and wait for Mi Band 7 Pro launch which has a better OS (Zepp OS) than these sub 4k watches like Boat, FireBolt etc ..Cons :1. Buggy Bluetooth connectivity2. No Touch to wake-up Display like Mi Bands3. Slight Lag with Gesture Display and option to customize Gesture to turn on the watch4. Weather App DOESN'T work5.

But..!,"Rating lacks one star 🌟 because the developers missed a key (rather basic) feature to put the device in a silent or conveniently vibration only mode. The device shines in all other aspects but all those appreciable things have been compromised because of this. You only gets two options, either you can allow the device to make sound during incoming calls or put the device in DND and disable the whole calling functionality. So the basic question is, why we can't receive the incoming calls without ringing.?

Gotta say the Xtend is better than Xtend Pro. This is hilarious!The Pro looks more premium and has a nice smooth finish, but the software OMG is so so bad. Doesnt sync with the app automatically, and even when you do it manually, it misses syncing data! I lost a full day of steps and exercise data when I had done a 15km walk. Was so disappointed.

 9 August 2022,ChandniChandni,Worst Smart Watch from Boat,"Worst Smart Watch ever I bought. Only Display and Bluetooth Calling is good.1. Display is very good as it is Amoled.2. Bluetooth Calling is clear but not usable all time because I don't like talk on speakers.3. Watch Faces are pathetic, not a single watch face is good on cloud and customise option.4. Weather is not showing on watch while connected to phone, so it's a gimmick only.5. Heart rate monitor is not accurate, it read non living things like chair's arm rest and evry round shape things.6. All other main sensors like walking, sleeping are not accurate.So my final verdict is, Boat only focus on Amoled Display and Bluetooth Calling Facility and forget the main work of a Smart Watch which is Fitness Tracking. It is for those who only wear smart watch to see time and date. Don't buy if you want it for fitness tracking. Redmi Band is better than this. Don't buy this watch if you want good looking watch face because it's watch faces are crap. No watch face has all main sensor counts dusplay. I will never buy any boat product in future because of this pathetic experience.SO DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP.....",1,B0B574QXFL,Colour: Active Black | Style Name: BT Calling+AMOLED | Pattern Name: Smart Watch,BOAT,SMART WATCH
 16 September 2022,Gurudatta Sonawane,Very bad in tearms of connectivity. Frequently disconnected from mobile.,"In tearms of connectivity is very bar.1) frequently disconnected from mobile after also bluetooth is ON.2) NOT synchronising in background with app and also not live synchronisation works.3) everytime app start its start to synchronising and take almost 2 min.4) bluetooth calling is not optimised, also have disconnection issue.5) raise to wakeup is slow and much delay in wakeup.6) if not wearing still checking and measuring heart rate and blood oxigen!! Seriously boat need to lot of work in smartwatch section.7) not able to detect its on wrist or not.Only plus point is amoled display and rest of things only just like gimmick. Not working well.Previously i used honor band 5 and seriously never face this kind of issue. Even actual medical equipment results and honor band 5 heart rate and blood oxigen results almost 99% accurate. Body detection available, if not wearing than never measures anything not even steps. But with boat i completely disappointed.

 28 September 2022,Vedant Lad,Clearly avoid if looking for fitness,"Will divide the review in pros and cons to keep it straight.Pros:1) display - Good display which is bright and probably had the best touch in the segment. Also the response time is very good.2) Built - It's decent for the price , nothing fancy but yes the built feels good.3) Light weight!Cons -Heart rate is improper, SpO2 is a big joke as it always shows 99 , This watch can't be kept on silent.  It's either ringing loud or dnd with no notification alert (so the calling feature is waste if you are in office) , sleep tracking is again worst, step counting is poor and if you link with g fit then it might sync and show little good readings.Overall it's a cheap product but if you're want something to have on your wrist which does minimal things done. Then you can go for it.Health tracking would be a joke on this.

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team.

 26 July 2022,Rahul Ray,Very bad software by boAt,"Bought this item on 24th July... It is so cool looking and have almost all the features that anyone can look for in a smartwatch...But IDK what happens with boAt's software, I'm facing two vital issues with the device that forced to raise a replacement issue.1. Battery back up is sooooo bad. It didn't even last for one full day (24 hours at least) with low/moderate usage. I charged the device at 100% before going to sleep and switched it off. When I woke up in the morning, it showed that it has only 70% of battery available... Remember, the device was completely powered of at night!!!After using it throughout the evening on 26thJuly (with NO CALL), it decreased from 100% to 80% in 1 hour!!2. Bluetooth connection is not working... Phone is getting paired to boAt wearables app easily but somehow it is not showing ""Bluetooth connected"" icon in device ... Also I'm unable to make/manage any call via this device except for the reject option...I tried resetting for multiple times but it doesn't work... I made a replacement request on 26th July and waiting for a fresh product.Apart from that, the watch is beautiful indeed... The display, custom watch faces option, sport modes, alarm, camera, stopwatch, heart rate monitor, oxygen monitor, seeing notifications of your choices...P.S.: Today is 17th August & I have received my replacement product... This time, the watch connects to device bluetooth at a glance by ""CALL_BT"" & everything seemed fine... But that was first and last time I guess ... The watch never get it's bluetooth calling connected again!!!!Tried multiple reset and re-installing software but didn't work... So, Returning!!!!!!!!!boAt, it's tough to gain Customer's trust & faith, but it's that so easy to destroy... And you are doing the same..... Your end is near, be prepared....",1,B0B5B6PQCT,Colour: Active Black | Size: 1.69 inch,BOAT,SMART WATCH

Watch faces are just average and hope boat will add more faces in future updation. Blutooth connectivity with phone is sometimes tricky,cause BT will connect with phone only after disconnect with boat app( this issue happening sometimes). Call clarity, speaker sound and mic is good.

 12 August 2021,AndyAndy,Best Budget watch,"The media could not be loaded. �Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.1) Large Curved  Display in this price category - 1.69 inch2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby  while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.2)  Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40  seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer.  In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while  traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.Few  other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.2) Remote shutter button for camera.3) Call silencing option could have been added.",5,B096VF1PJ8,Colour: Olive Green | Style Name: With Alexa,BOAT,SMART WATCH

 29 August 2021,Rohit,HONEST REVIEW POST USING IT FOR 2 MONTHS,"Pros: Good battery life and good looks (when screen not on)Cons:1. The display is not at all colorful. It is so dull that it actually makes you dislike the watch. C'mon that's the least expectation from a 4k watch. Display is really really dull and bad.2. Doesn't connect to Google Fit. Well, it does in theory but the steps taken in watch won't ever be updated in your Google fit account. So if you've taken insurance and get discounts with steps taken (my agenda), it doesn't fullfill that agenda.3. Steps count are inaccurate and doesn't match at times. The app keeps logging out and when you log back in, it mismatches the steps4. I wore it at night to check my sleep, and I couldn't find any record in the app next morning. In fact, it is still showing only one day sleep recorded on July 8th for 3 hours. Guess I'm a sleepless zombie now..Verdict: Don't go for this clock.

 7 May 2022,Placeholder,More than what you pay for,"I have received this product a couple of days ago and now I am going to give an honest review of it.This product is a great item if you are looking for a budget smartwatch. For its price, it provides quite accurate measurements of your BPM, stress, SPO2 etc. I have verified it's measurements with an actual oximeter and it proved to be accurate. However, the pedometer of the watch randomly adds around 100 steps. The pedometer is accurate otherwise.The touch display of the 1.69"" watch impressed me. The watch has a sharp display, and smooth touch, which makes you feel like you are on a smartphone. The response time is quite well too. However, the animations lag which is not very eye pleasing, but workable.The battery is great. The watch would be powered on for one whole night and would not lose a single percent of battery. Even while using, it loses a reasonable amount of power. For first time users, who just received their product: You might notice the battery is draining extremely quick. Do not panic. It is recommended to charge the battery for at least 2 hours before first use. It stabilizes the battery. The next time you use your watch, it would work as normal.The built-in Alexa is perhaps my favorite feature of this watch. It's response time is around 5 seconds, and is quite fun to use a virtual assistant on the go. It can tell you facts, jokes, weather, calculations, translations and loads of other stuff, which might be useful for quickly looking up something. However, Alexa does not have a speaker. It gives a text output. The text output can sometimes end with ""..."" (ellipses) which mean the output is too long to print. It can also fail to provide relevant output at times.You need to log in to Alexa with your Amazon account in the boAt Wave App.There are 100+ watch faces in the wave app, which you can use to customize your watch with whatever that suits your personality. You can even use your own pictures. However, you cannot customize the time font if you choose to do that, which, in my opinion, is quite limiting.Notifications in the watch is pretty cool, and comes in handy when you do not wish to open your phone for it. Call alerts come, and you can reject them but not accept. Makes sense as the watch does not have a speaker. It vibrates.It has a good build quality and is water-resistant.Other cool features are sleep tracking, breathing exercise, alarms, timers, flashlights etc.Overall, a pretty decent watch if you are looking for something in this range of price.",4,B096VFND31,Colour: Sandy Cream | Style Name: With Alexa,BOAT,SMART WATCH

 15 September 2022,Deepesh Bhagat,Good for starters.,I do not expect much from it so its good for me. Though found overpriced looking to the features. Using from last 6 days. still 50 % battery left. (depends on usage also). fitness applications working good. thats what I bought it for. Alarms for drinking water / alarms for walking after a fixed intervals while at desk are wonderful. Memory for watch faces is limited to less then 10. everytime you need a new watch face you have to download in mobile app (you have to remove the last one you have installed to down load new). you can not just browse on the watch for watch faces and select the one you want. (only 7-8 faces available at a time). Also default watch faces can not to deleted to have all 7-8 faces of your choice. This is irritating.

The watch lost all functionality within minutes of its first exposure to water. My son just dipped it in water for some time, and the touchscreen stopped responding thereafter, as can be seen in the video. It just goes to prove that the watch is not water resistant at all, and the company is either just making a false claim about it, or the manufacturing/ quality control processes of the company are extremely poor. Any which way, it just shows the company in a very poor light.This is exactly how people loose faith in companies, and companies end up loosing customer base.

It does login you in dedicated app for android. Unable to use custom faces because. There are a lot of issues in application. The UI can be fixed if they add animations and improve performance from software side by an OTA update. Not sure they will release OTA update soon fir this specific watch. Simply, the watch on the exterior looks great but it performs very bad at software performance. It has a lot if issues. Perhaps, the developers for this watch should improve the user applications(playstore app) and release a new software update soon before people just buy and return the product after 3-4 days of usage.",1,B096VDJ5QX,Colour: Deep Blue | Style Name: With Alexa,BOAT,SMART WATCH

 25 February 2023,Damini,Wastage of money,"If you're reading the reviews to decide whether or not to buy this watch, I'll sum it up in one word: DON'T. It's not worth it.I bought this last year in June and initially it worked fine. But within 3 weeks from the date of delivery, the wake up gesture function stopped working. So I went to the service center as per the address given on Boat website but there they refused to service the product and redirected me to another service center. And guess what? There too, they said that they do not provide service for boat smartwatches. So I had to travel to yet another center which is not even in Kolkata but in the Suburban area to get my product exchanged. The scenario at this place was yet more disappointing. There was long queue of people and most of them had issues related to smartwatches that started malfunctioning within days of purchase. The place is grossly understaffed and in no way capable of handling the huge rush they get everyday, thanks to the low quality products that the company is selling. Anyway, took me nearly 4 hours to submit my watch and I got a replacement delivered to my house within 1 week. It was all good until a couple of days ago, I found out that the watch is malfunctioning. The wake up gesture is not working yet again along with other problems. I'm too frustrated to go through the ordeal of exchanging the product again cause frankly, the experience at the service center was nothing short of a nightmare. Any product that requires multiple replacements within warranty period is definitely not worth the time or energy.I think the people writing positive reviews here are the ones who got lucky with their products or just wrote the review too soon before using it for a while. From my experience, they manufacture and deliver too many faulty products and that's a real harrassment to the people who buy it. So yes, long story short, I would definitely NOT recommend buying this garbage that they are calling a smartwatch. It will save both your money and time.",2,B096VFND31,Colour: Sandy Cream | Style Name: With Alexa,BOAT,SMART WATCH

 18 January 2023,Ameya,Inaccurate data tracking,"I have been using this smart watch for over 7 weeks regularly. It captures sleep details well. However, captures incorrect health (fitness) data. For example, if I start working out but forget to switch on the associated sports mode, it doesn't capture any calorie burning. On the other hand, if I switch on a sports mode while sitting idle, it shows increased heart rate and burnt calories. So basically the watch has pre-fed data for each sport mode and the watch displays that. The watch is useless then. The app is bad!!!! Hangs frequently. I won't recommend buying this (un)smart watch.",2,B09MQSCJQ1,Colour: Charcoal Black | Style Name: With Alexa,BOAT,SMART WATCH

 23 July 2022,Iron Man,Design and looks are good. Great battery life! Rest all disappoints!,"I purchased this on my friend's recommendation since he had seen someone else wear it and his initial impressions were good, plus this was on sale.The reality, both of us realized, was different.Pros:- Great looks. Feels good on your hand with that circular dial.- Build quality is good too. No complaints there, given the price (I got it for ��1800)- Battery life was accurate for me and my friend too. No disappointments there. You can full charge and forget about it for 2 to 3 weeks.- The accessories provided were working and convenient to use.- The companion app was okay enough. Not amazing, but not bad too.Cons: I use a smart-band or watch for its features more than looks. This one disappoints in terms of features :- Inaccurate and very bland sleep tracking stats. Just numbers and no details around different sleep stages. There is a reason why you track your sleep, to improve the quality - this won't help at all.- Inaccurate step count.- Notifications just don't work on this watch it seems. Its like the watch has a mood of its own. If it is your lucky day, it may notify you of a text/email/call, otherwise forget about it. This was the biggest con for me. When I have my phone in my pocket or away and I get a notification (call/message/alarm), I can choose to reach for me phone or not based on that.  That is a big advantage IMO of a smart band/watch, but you won't find it working on this one.- There are a lot of watch faces but there would be very few that one would like to use. The makers seem to have focused more on quantity than quality.What disappointed me more was my expectation with this one while purchasing it. I have been using Honor Band 5 for over 18 months and trust me all features work really well. The tracking may not be perfect but it is still satisfactory and doesn't spoil the experience, unlike this smart watch. After using this  for 4 weeks, out of frustration I went back to using my Honor band 5 and kept this one back in the original packaging - not sure what I would do!I hope this was useful in clearing out some questions!",3,B0949SBKMP,Colour: Lightning Black | Pattern Name: Smartwatch,BOAT,SMART WATCH

At least for this watch, u don't have too many features, and you have to use your phone to set up most of the things ( like alerts and notifications, Do not disturb mode and even alarms too!!)Other than that, its touch response is pretty decent, has got nice watch faces (you can make your own as well) and battery is long lasting (at least for my usage, lasts more than 10 days).Also notice that the wrist isn't black, its dark grey.

 30 July 2021,Sagar G.,Not the best for sleep tracking,"This is my first smartwatch and brought it during Prime day sale on its launch. It's fine considering its price tag but not great.When it comes to Sleep tracking, it only calculates sleep b/w 10PM to 8AM and only if watch does not detect any movement for half n hour or so, what if I sleep around outside this time? Even when I woke up it continued to record it as sleep and only stopped when I got out to bed.In terms of looks, the dail is a plastic material and does not have that glossy shine.",3,B0949SBKMP,Colour: Lightning Black | Pattern Name: Smartwatch,BOAT,SMART WATCH

 12 September 2022,Alwin T.Alwin T.,Good watch for the first time user,It is a nice watch for this price tag. After 11 months of usage one thing I didn't like is it's sleep tracking. From previous two weeks it doesn't track the sleep at all. Don't know the reason why. Rest everything is good. All other functionalities are working fair enough.

 20 August 2021,Navnit Srivastava,Just a normal smart watch,"Let's start with cons first :1. Screen resolution is poor.2. touch sensitive is not good.3. Frequently disconnects with its app. I think the app has the problem.4. Large collection of watch faces is available but their design and looks are pathetic. Added with poor screen resolution, it will make you inconvenient with all the watch faces. This is the moment when I completely regretted purchasing this watch. Now I have compromised with the most important thing in a smart watch.5. This watch is not even designed in a way that protects it from scratch.6. Battery indicator is inaccurate.7. Charging wire is of cheap quality8. The watch looks 20% 'cheap', 75% 'average' & 5% 'good' when the screen is off. But when the screen is on it looks 30-35% 'cheap' 60-65% 'average' & 0-5% 'good'.9. It takes lot of time to change watchfaces through app.Pros:1. This watch is loaded with many fearures.2. Accuracy of HR, blood oxygen & step counts.3. Slim design.Don't buy if it costs more than ��2000/-I spent ��2499/- on this.

 7 August 2021,erin,Good battery life,"Works as predicted. Water resistance is good, can easily shower with it on, which is an important feature for me.Watch faces are limited. This is actually a ticwatch. So you can use yfit app (but don't upgrade the firmware if it prompts) this app allows you to pick the apps to alert you. The boat app is limited for alerts.If you want a lot of custom faces take watch with Google Wear OS.It would be great if an always on display were there. But at this price point it's a worthy watch. Sensors are not like medical equipment in most watches. The locate phone works well but need to have Bluetooth on. The default boat app lacks a lot of settings. Play music doesn't work on boat app, so yfit app seems better. Again don't upgrade firmware thru yfit",5,B0949SBKMP,Colour: Lightning Black | Pattern Name: Smartwatch,BOAT,SMART WATCH

But, this watch gives results on every non living object proving that it's software has been designed to give fake results when sensor is not able to receive the signals.Sleep tracking is horrible!!!!My fatherw goes for walk at 5AMThis watch records his steps but also shows that he is sleeping upto 7AM. Even time at which we go to sleep is recorded the same regardless the time we actually sleep.This band doesn't recognise afternoon naps.So, if you are searching for a health tracking device any of the boat watches aren't for you. As they're working on same software.Better go for honor.

I just dis warm up excursuses standing in one place, and voila...the step count increased and showed I travelled for  0.4 Kms. The sleep tracker.....let me not open that thread......all BS. How was this product ever released. It's should be recalled and displayed in the museums of stupidity. You know what, better to invest the money and by a goAt.

 27 September 2022,Kshitij kumar verma,Battery Sudden dry after full charged || Cheap Very Discusting Low Quality Product  ||,The media could not be loaded. �Writing review after using of 15 days.It's not about price it's about quality. Battery Sudden Got Drain after full charged. I strongly recommend not to buy.I don't why Amazon has approv this product to list his app. Very disappointing and Totally wastage of money 1299.,3,B0B7JTQVKQ,Colour: Olive Green | Style Name: Non BT Calling,BOAT,SMART WATCH
 27 September 2022,JacksonJackson,Great!,"A really great product from boAt!Charged 0-100% within one hour(battery was drained in the box). Charger is good, it's a metallic 2-pin type, not usb type. After 2 hours of use battery is still at 99% so that's a good thing to note.If you want to increase battery life, toggle off the heart rate monitor in the boAt Crest app, because repeated heart rate readings will just drain your battery.Sometimes there will be connection issues, just download the boAt Crest app first and pair using the app (don't pair with bluetooth by going to device settings).Also don't be alarmed if the time and date is wrong when you use the watch out of the box. It gets corrected when connected to your phone.After pairing, when bluetooth is switched on in the phone, the watch connects within 2 or 3 seconds so that's good. Bluetooth connectivity has a maximum range of 5-7 metres.Display is good, I can see the dial properly even in bright sunlight and from all angles too.I have to say, dial faces didn't come up quite to my expectations, but we can use pics from gallery so no issues there.SpO2 and heart rate monitor works fine.Camera control, music control works fine(for camera you have to open the boAt Crest app)Flashlight mode is really a last-resort type thing, display ain't got that much brightness�.Notifications are all coming properly, you have to enable it in the boAt app.Gesture turn on works great.Strap looks sturdy.Various sports modes are nice.You also get standard things like stopwatch, timer, find your phone etc.Also note that this is NOT A BLUETOOTH CALLING WATCH. Do pay attention to that.Overall, it's worth 1299.These are my initial observations. I will be editing my review after one week's use to provide a more proper verdict.Edit : 5-6% of the battery is drained per day when it's on standby, which is more or less in agreement with the maximum working time of 15 days claimed by boAt.Also, volume control doesn't work for some reason.I've been using for 2 weeks now and I am happy to note that everything else is working fine.Will edit my review after one month's useCheers!",5,B0B7JTQM6Y,Colour: Active Black | Style Name: Non BT Calling,BOAT,SMART WATCH

 29 March 2023,Abhilash Kulkarni,Hyped product requires enhancements,"PositivesVery handy - I've answered calls & made calls from the watch and the clarity is very good. Clarity when playing music from watch is very good. It monitors my foot steps well and has several other functionality. It has 1 year warranty and when provided feedback on amazon I was told additional 3 months warranty by the support staff.NegativesI had bought this product looking at the rating on Amazon and within 1 week I was surprised the strap of the watch is torn/broken! Thankfully, there was replacement available and got it replaced within 1 week of purchase. The MRP of the product is Rs.20,000! How can a simple essential thing (Strap) get torn within 1 week of purchase! The themes available are very limited though one can add ones own photo from Gallery. Battery drains faster (lasts one day) when constantly connected to mobile bluetooth & playing music for few hours; without playing music or not connected to mobile it can last for more than 2-3 days.",4,B0BF57RN3K,Colour: Black,FIRE BOLTT,SMART WATCH

Since I haven't used it for more days, not very sure about the accuracy of sleep, step, heart, o2 trackers but looks like it's good.

Other features like temperature, what's app/normal messanger, AI assistance (google/alexa), music controller, 3 games, alarm, notifications, stop watch, mobile camera controller is good feature to have. Appearance and clarity Good. You can find your phone if misplaced/lost through smartwatch and vise versa if within blutooth range.Battry charge lasts not more than 3-4 days if Continuesly connected via Bluetooth.Price could have been little lower or features /trackers could have been more (Fire bolt to provide more features duringnext update)Some of the Watch faces are not so good. (the one displayed in video is customized and included by me).

The lightweight then Ring 3 and call qualities are improved.Other functions are working but need to check the durability and long-time usage. Currently charging every 3-4 days.

On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable.5) You can make calls or receive calls from the watch itself. Microphone and speaker quality is quite decent.6) Torch makes the display bright white. Comes handy in darkness.7) Remote shutter button for camera.",5,B0BF57RN3K,Colour: Black,FIRE BOLTT,SMART WATCH

Why the extra step? Why not just consider swiping left as a removal of notifications?Calls on the watch only have the reject button. There is no button to accept the call from the watch.Google Fit Sync doesnt workYou can only store 5 watch faces at a time.

 26 January 2023,SharadSharad,Good value for money in this range,"Pros :1. Super battery life with heart rate monitoring always on2. Sleep monitoring is accurate3. Screen display with color rendering is wonderful. Customized watch face allows gallery photo to be applied on face and it displays in wonderful contrast and colors.Cons :1. Steps monitoring is totally skewed. Both distance walked and steps covered are reported 60 to 75% less. Needs immediate software upgrade to resolve this discrepancy.2. Screen is very delicate and gets permanently scratched even with the slightest rub. Has to have an external guard for protection.3. Watch faces are plenty but useful ones are very few. Gallery is filled with faces having different backgrounds and same basic data. Does not work. Variety needs to be offered in data displayed on screen4. Weather sync with watch works with one upgrade and then stops in the next software upgrade. Requires serious effort by developers to fix it permanently.Recent update after using this watch for good 6 months. The nHealth software for syncing this watch is a total junk. Earlier it only failed to sync weather data and could manage to do it only after multiple manual attempts. But since last couple of weeks (precisely 22nd March 2023 onwards) it has totally conked off. Keeps showing network unavailable even with the watch and wifi internet connected and fails to sync any data. No watch faces available, no workout data, weather data, health data sync working. Several people are facing this issue and have raised complaints on OnePlus community but to no effect. This app needs urgent update pending since dec 22. Downgrading 1 star from my previous rating and attaching screenshots of the error message.",5,B0BD93V6RY,Colour: Blue,ONE PLUS,SMART WATCH

" August 1, 2022",Caleb,"It's got its flaws, but overall a very strong choice","8/10/2022: So far, I'm still really enjoying my Pixel. A solid 4.5 out of 5.The biggest drawback so far is one I didn't mention originally: the charging time. It's not BAD, necessarily, but still slower than my previous 4-year-old phone. It takes about an hour to charge from 0% to 80%. The battery life hasn't been an issue, at least; I can get through a day on about 60% charge.I've gotten used to the fingerprint sensor, though it is still a little finicky.Regarding overheating, I regularly work in 90-110 degrees Fahrenheit for several hours at a time, and I haven't had any glaring issues. It just gets a little draggy when it's hot. (And apparently, it won't let you use the flash when it's warm.)One great thing I didn't mention before are the haptics/vibration. I particularly like them in this phone for typing, etc. I can always feel it in my pocket when I'm getting a call, which I can't say for the last few phones I've had before this one.8/1/2022: I've had this phone for only a couple of days now, but my first impressions are very positive. My previous phone was the Essential PH-1, which now has a shot battery, and my biggest struggle in finding a replacement for it was finding a device that was the right size. There are plenty of great phones for this price range out there, but almost all of them are all HUGE.Funnily enough, there's already a great review by another previous Essential PH-1 user, so I'll probably end up repeating a few of the same points.THE PROS:-The camera experience is MUCH better on the Pixel than with the PH-1. Google phone cameras have never failed me.-The stock-feeling Android experience is great and super snappy on the Pixel, and rather customizable. I love being able to activate dark mode on all of my standard apps. Besides that, it will be receiving updates for 5 more years.-The phone design is sharp and the Sage color is unexpectedly cool. The back feels like glass but is made of plastic, which obviously helps to make the phone feel as lightweight as it does. The buttons are nice and clicky.-I use Straight Talk as my carrier. So far, reception has been great, even compared to the Essential PH-1.-The size is NEARLY 100% PERFECT, but it borders on being just a touch on the tall side. I still like the shape enough that I don't mind a bit. I have medium-large hands, and I really wanted to stay with a slim device that fits comfortably in one hand and thrives with single-thumb use.-Some are concerned about the phone's 60 hz refresh rate. I've never actually owned a phone with anything higher, so as far as I'm concerned, the display is buttery smooth.THE MEH:-So far, I haven't experienced any overheating or bugs... with one exception. For whatever reason, my Pixel did not ship with the Magic Eraser tool in the photo editing app.-Battery life isn't exactly life-changing, but it'll get you through a full day's use after an hour's charge, no problem. Even intensive use doesn't seem to drain the battery too quickly.-The dual speakers are nice, but I noticed max volume is comparatively sorta quiet.THE CONS:-My only real nitpick with this phone so far is the front/display fingerprint sensor. After owning a device with a rear fingerprint sensor, it feels like a bit of a drawback. The PH-1's rear sensor provided instant unlock, whereas the Pixel's front sensor is barely slower AND a little finicky; sometimes, it takes a couple of tries for it to recognize my thumbprint. It works decently enough even with a screen protector, but like any fingerprint sensor, I wouldn't expect great results if your fingerprint is worn away at all.-It comes with a usb-c to usb-c charging cable, but no charger block. I highly dislike that trend.OVERALL, I am really enjoying the phone and hope it does hold out well for the next 5 years of updates. Even with my small nitpick concerning the fingerprint sensor, I love the camera, the lightweight Android experience, and especially the phone's size.",5,B0B3Q23BT4,Color: Sage | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" August 27, 2022",josh1000f,A Step Down - I want my 3a back,"This phone makes me wish I could easily replace the battery in my pixel 3a. I hear they're making easy battery replacement a law in Europe, and I really hope the U.S. follows that lead soon!PROS: Overall, the phone is a decent functioning phone as one would expect, the display is good, the photos are really good and in general it does about as good as most of the pixels I've owned, with a few notable exceptions (see below). I've had a Pixel 1, and a 3a, and now this 6a, so I have a fair amount of experience with these phones, which is probably why this one is so far a disappointment.CONS: I already miss the headphone jack. I used to plug my phone into my (older) computer speakers from time to time, but that's no longer an option. I hope the jack comes back in future devices, but it seems like that's unlikely.BATTERY LIFE is not good. In the past, my new pixels would last for a day and a half, even under heavy use, but this one can't even make it from 7am to dinner time. Maybe the lack of a headphone jack and the extra use of bluetooth is a factor, but I'm not very happy that I have to recharge a brand new phone at 5pm almost daily.FINGERPRINT READER - this is probably the most noticeable step backward from my pixel 3a. The rear print reader on the 3a was lightning fast and conveniently located. The screen fingerprint reader on the 6a is terrible. I'd estimate that the phone only unlocks on the first try around 50% of the time. This is super annoying when you're driving and just trying to change the streaming channel. Also, the ""stay unlocked on home wifi"" feature is either broken on mine or is also terrible, as my phone is constantly locking and requiring me to use the crappy fingerprint reader when I'm at home.SCREEN BRIGHTNESS - On my 3a I could set my adaptive brightness where I wanted it and it would adjust to differing light conditions nearly flawlessly, but the 6a again, is a step down. Sometimes it goes extremely dark, other times it jumps to 100%... it's very unpredictable and almost seems broken. Again, the 3a was a far better device.In closing, I can't recommend this phone. I mean, if you're using a free phone that came with your wireless plan, the 6a might be a step up, but compared to the past pixels I've owned, this one is hands-down the runt of the litter. Maybe I'll get used to it, but I'm already thinking of trading it in for something else.",3,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" October 10, 2022",Wes,"Update, see below! NOT OEM Unlocked phone as the description states!","Original review: This phone is not really unlocked. The OEM Unlock option is greyed out in Developer Options!Update!!! The phone I received came with Android 12 Apr2022 version, which will not let you enable the OEM Unlock option in Developer Options. However, once I went to System Updates and let it install Android 12 Jun2022 security update, factory reset the phone, connected to WiFi (all without a SIM inserted), I was able to enable the OEM Unlock option in Developer Options. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars as I am sure many of us are trying to enable the OEM Unlock option and there are no instructions/messages from the supplier about the version issue. At least not one that I could find. I had to Google around to find a solution.",4,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" on December 9, 2022",Krunal,Best phone for 30K!!!,"Update: Don't buy from Amazon!!!! If you buy from amazon, warranty is not given by google. You can claim warranty only if bought from Flipkart!!I was using Redmi note 5 from last 4 years & wanted a phone for balancing my requirements as Office work apps (Teams, Outlook, workplace etc.), Utilities, Good camera (not oppo vivo type face beuty, but really a good camera), Good battery that lasts atleast 1 full day under heavy use, Compact design & also some gaming.I was skeptical about battery life as many users reported it as issue that under mobile network battery drains fast, but I am using it daily on mobile network only, no such issue is found.Its 9th Dec & we got new dec update, after which fingerprint reader has improved..its smoother now. Camera will not disappoint you for sure, Image after processing is at best.I will also suggest you to get Cardboard app & a VR set (cheaper one), which will give next level experience.Don't buy Cover & glass online, if you have mobile market nearby, then buy from there. I got very smooth silicon cover with cushion pading from inside at 150 rs & glass at 150 also, which are availabe at 400-500 rs online.Back cover is must as given glass back design attracts fingerprint and also is vulnerable to scratches (yes...scratches from keys if you put mobile & keys in same pocket).Buy a 20W adaptor (C-type & Simple one inputs), which is sufficient. It charges faster if you use Cable given by google, & slowly with other cables.Overall, I got what I expected. If you have same expectations as mine, just go for it.",4,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" January 25, 2023",amanooensis,Just okay,"I read many reviews before buying this. I waded through endless nonsense about playing games and taking selfies to get to factors I needed: voice calls, texts, email, and other apps that actually get things done, and maybe the occasional video or music app. I had high hopes, but I'm running into a lot of disappointment so far.  Transitioning to stock Android 12 from stock Android 10 was easy. The Pixel's cable and built-in instructions helped import all my old apps, often with settings and data intact. I had to re-enter a few passwords, tweak some settings, etc. but it was far less work than I expected. The immediate Android 13 upgrades were easy, although slow.  Some companies make ruggedized, military-grade phones. This isn't one of them, in fact it uses mostly midrange materials. So of course I use a case and screen protector.  Well, they say all newer Google phones have a hard time recognizing fingerprints, especially with a screen protector. I set the finger sensitivity to high. No difference. Stored multiple recordings of the same fingerprint to enhance recognizability. No difference. The only help I found came from other reviewers, one of whom suggested rubbing the fingertip on his face to pick up skin oil, or another who advised licking the fingertip to make it wet. These are the low-tech solutions to Google's high-tech design failure.  Bottom line: an in-screen sensor is a stupid idea and its performance is just as bad as you've heard. Maybe you'll get lucky, but be prepared to enter passwords or codes or patterns or some other unlock method.  It seems to use power quickly, and definitely charges more slowly than my older, cheaper phone, regardless of charger or cable. No wireless charging and nothing like any kind of actual “fast” charging.  We have an app through our phone company to locate all phones in the family. It can find a Nokia or Samsung to within 50-100 feet. But it struggles to locate this phone at all, and then only to within about 1000 feet, indoors or outdoors. The phone has multiple setting options for location precision, permission, GPS vs. Wifi vs Bluetooth, etc. I've checked Google help and user forums, phone company help and user forums, reviews etc. Nothing helps, and this is a big deal to me.  I used my old phone to listen to music, mono speaker and all. It had a headphone jack of course, and an app to tune in FM radio. You could plug in studio-quality headphones. The Pixel speakers are stereo, but not nearly as loud. There's no FM radio and the headphone audio via USB is lower than headphones plugged into an audio jack on the old phone. A scam to force people to buy expensive Bluetooth headphones and headsets when they already own wired versions of both.  The Pixel 6A is a bit narrower than my old phone, which makes the Gboard virtual keyboard narrower; and individual letters seem even narrower than they need to be. So it's harder to type on. I have not tried experimenting with an external USB keyboard, or any other USB “on-the-go” function. There's reportedly no good way to view this phone on an external monitor, unlike most Samsungs for instance.  Its chips are faster than my old phone and it has more working memory. I'm gradually getting used to the finicky “upgraded” Android 13 gesture system, which is better for some actions and worse for others. The phone size suits my needs, it has 5G and high-speed wifi which are definite upgrades.  I haven't used it much for pictures or video but it seems competent for those. I was recently at a meeting where people were discussing complex topics, so I tried out the recorder app so as not to miss anything. It not only picked up faint voices pretty well, it also transcribed them to text in real time, with varying levels of accuracy.  So there are a few pluses, and I'll live with the phone. But I'll keep my eyes open for some better alternative, rather than waiting a few years for the software support to end. This is not what I wanted when making this purchase, so with all things considered, it is disappointing.",3,B0B3Q23BT4,Color: Sage | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" August 4, 2022",TS,Seems perfectly cromulent. (update),"Update 2: Phone would not connect to mobile network!  Would connect for a few minutes and then drop mobile/data/gps connection, it was such a bummer.  After trying to fix it for a week and even changing mobile carriers, nothing worked- I decided to finally just return the phone and get a new one (same model).  To my surprise, I have had none of the issues with the replacement.  It shipped in a shoebox-size box with no cushioning, which I did not appreciate.  But none of the overheating issues (gets warm but not nearly as bad), none of the issues connecting, etc.So, as an actual functioning phone, and not a cause of intense stress: pretty solid?  Not in love with it relative to the original cost, but it looks pretty (I got the sage), and it works about as well as I would expect.  Fingerprint scanner is not amazing, but seems to be working noticeably better since update.  I have had to redo the finger scan to get it to work.  Also the limit of 4 fingers seems arbitrary, but I have both of my thumbs and pointer fingers which is good enough.Battery life is a bit of a disappointment!  Lasts about a day, and not necessarily a full 24 hours.  Not an issue for me but was hoping for a little extra.  The battery saver mode works pretty well it seems, I don't even notice the difference when it is in use.  Screen is bright enough to view during daylight hours at full brightness, and looks good.  Camera works well, and even low-light photos come out pretty decent.I would prefer a regular audio jack, but have not had any issues other than having to pony up $7 for a USBC/3.5mm adapter.  I do wonder about the life of the port, since the power and audio jack are doing double-duty.Verdict: Pretty good phone!  It ruined my life, briefly.______Update1: Google pushed out an update around 8/4, which means they knew about the issues that people like me were having for a while.Phone still gets very warm, but overheating issue is much better. Does not seem to get quite as hot, and also it does not shut down the way it used to. It used to happen several times per day in any number of situations, but I've only seen it give me the overheating warning once in the last several days, when I was using the camera for about a half an hour. This is still a flaw, and not an issue I've run into with other smartphones.General complaints include the fact that I do not like the fingerprint reader. I'm upgrading from a Motorola Moto G5 S Plus that I've had for about four and a half years. The Pixel 6A fingerprint reader is built into the screen, and maybe that's why it is slower. If you are not used to a more responsive fingerprint reader you may not know the difference.Overall, I am not wowed.  Having dealt  with the overheating issue, it makes me suspicious about the life of the battery, in case any damage was done by the overheating processor.  At this point I am likely to keep the same model, but would want to be shipped a replacement unit just in case.  Not a strong recommendation.Original:I will try update this in a week or so, but it's not looking good so far.I have an overheating issue, which is apparently somewhat common with these phones.  Luckily I bought a case for it, because it's physically uncomfortable to hold without one.When the phone gets too hot, any number of bad things happen - cellular/data quality begins to degrade, or the phone will just shut down on its own.I have gotten some  irritating Google messages warning me about my phone overheating, and then giving me advice on what to do about it. I am not using it to stir nacho cheese, or take pictures of the inside of an active volcano. I'm not even playing games at all or watching videos that much - I'm doing regular cell phone things, and my phone doesn't like it.  The ""tips"" Google wants to give me are particularly irritating, because they already know this overheating is an issue, and they're attempting to pretend like it is a user problem and not a hardware / software issue.Anyway, I'm going to give it a few more days to see if the issue persists, but I'm very disappointed so far.  I may have to send it back in case this particular phone happens to be a dud.",3,B0B3Q23BT4,Color: Sage | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" September 6, 2022",G,This phone is amazing,"After a slow start out of the package (it woudn't connect to my wi-fi), I finally reset my router and was off to the races.To summarize: this phone is amazing, especially for the price. It's got a smoking good camera, (far better than my GF's S20), excellent performance with it's Google Tensor processor, is highly intuitive, and ported the data and apps from my old phone into the 6a in just a few minutes.I hear that the Pro is better as it has a faster refresh rate, but I saved a ton of money and can't imagine a better operating phone. One note--I'm not a gamer--if you are, you might be better off with the 6Pro.I've read where some people complained about it getting hot--the only time it heated up was when the processor was porting Gig's of data from my old phone. Since then, it's run cool as a cucumber.Don't let the 12Mp camera worry you--I almost considered returning it after I read that spec, but then I saw the photos--they are amazing! Some of the best I have ever taken. Plus, because they are 12Mp, they don't take up a ton of storage. I put some on my 4K 70"" TV and they looked astonishingly good. Night pics are also extremely high quality--this alone makes the camera a huge win for me.The bottom line is this phone is a REMARKABLE value for the money. It gives 98% of people everything they could possibly want and more. If you're considering it, go for it, I highly doubt you will be disappointed. It managed to turn a long-time Samsung guy into Pixel guy out of me, that's for sure.",5,B0B3PQPNKS,Color: Chalk | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" October 6, 2022",Mister16,You wont be dissapointed,"Coming from a Moto G Power from 2020 - got water damaged, so I was really looking for a budget-friendly phone with waterproof rating and a good camera for some simple photography. Overall, 9.5/10 - extremely solid phone coming from something like a moto g power.CAMERA 10/1010/10, firstly has google camera - an instant boost in rating. While I cant really super-fine tune the pro/manual settings, the camera is good enough where I don't really have to. All the major features are there - brightness/exposure, white balance, timed shots, etc. The camera modes included are actually amazing though - night mode was truly a shock to see in action (yes its that good). Google lens is on most modern androids now, and it works fine. the zoom is 5x max, 2x recommended, and it performs decent. the .7 mode is pretty damn good - especially for video. the stabilization on video is really sick and works surprisingly well. the phone's low spec camera is more then made up for in google's impressive post-processing capabilities. only thing wrong with the camera is the photo sphere - a feature I was really hyped to try. Dont get me wrong - it works - but not really that well, even with a tripod. Cant expect too much though for a $350 phone.PERFORMANCE - 9.5/10Absolutley flawless - no sudden restarts, no jitteriness, and any game I threw at it it performed well in. That's expected, though, as you're supposed to be getting the processor from google's pixel 6 and 6 pro. overheating isn't a problem, the phone has never alerted me yet, but it can get decently warm. without a case its noticeable and a bit unpleasant, nothing too bad though. with a case its barely noticeable. ill throw voice assistant in here too; nothing special with it - same quality as any other phone (this one at least seems to pick up me saying ""hey google"" though). The fingerprint sensor is shockingly good for an under-the-screen one (first imte I've had one like that). Yeah, it screws up sometimes, but nothing that my old phone wouldn't have screwed up for either - oily skin, dust, smudges, etc.EXTERIOR & MISC - 9.9/10""glass"" back is actually really well made, as I'm sure you've heard already. the plastic does really feel like glass, but has all the benefits of using plastic. the screen is gorilla glass 3, and has been fine with my one drop of it of like 3 feet. the waterproof rating I've been leery  to test what with my old phone, but from YT reviewers it seems perfectly reasonable for its rating. as far as the internal storage goes, its not a problem for me - but might be for most people. I already back up all my photo/video to google photos (and it is nice to have auto deletion of backed up items on pixel phones), but if I didn't i'd already be out of room, especially with the awesome camera. So be warned. If you're not a gigabyte-guzzler, though, you should be fie.OVERALL - 9.5/10",5,B0B3PQPNKS,Color: Chalk | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone

Practically indistinguishable from the other 999999 phones we can buy.So why a 3 star review?Because I can't get a case for it, and without a protective case it's just going to break in a week.The case I ordered from Amazon didn't work: broke literally *as I was putting it on the phone* the very first time.I physically went to 8 local phone shops, and called 4 more, and none of them carry any cases for this phone.If I can't get a case for it, then it's not worth $450 for 1 week of use before I drop it and it breaks.",3,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" August 11, 2022",Peter Jay,Great phone but,"I miss the larger screen and rear fingerprint reader of my Pixel 3XL. I did need 5G, however, so I got this.Otherwise it's a great phone.As with my previous Pixels, I use Nova Launcher 7 and have system navigation set to 3-button navigation. IMO swipes suck, and are even more of an issue with Nova Launcher. Also as with all Pixels since my first 2 XL, the camera is just great, obviously improved since my original.The fingerprint reader is only so-so. Had to um.. give it the finger several times to get it to respond to certain fingers, but it's still kinda balky. And that's before I put a screen protector on. As I've read, I might have to enroll them there fingers again after that.Might still swap it out for a 6 or 6 pro because of the screen size.",4,B0B3PQPNKS,Color: Chalk | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" August 8, 2022",kaz,I like it so far!,"I got the charcoal 6a with free $50 Amazon gift card (so the phone was essentially $399), which Amazon shipped with adequate padding.On the first day, the phone got VERY hot and the battery drained pretty fast, but that was likely due to all the updates and setup going on in the background. No heat or battery problems in the following days, with the battery lasting safely through the whole day. I also turned off 5g, which may have helped with battery life/overheating.Misc thoughts:- I mostly use the phone for messaging, photos, and social media, so the 60hz display refresh rate doesn't bother me (you can reduce animation speed in developer options to make it feel faster)- the fingerprint reader has been reasonably responsive and accurate, even with a glass screen protector- the phone feels easier to hold (lighter, narrower) than my previous 6.3""+ phones, which my wrists appreciate- very solid basic Android experience with limited bloatware pre-installed. Lots of cool features, like notification snoozing, now playing, and the Material You theme- the back of the phone does feel kind of slippery, but I got a case so that's a non-issue nowI do miss the headphone jack, but these days I mostly use Bluetooth earbuds with my phone anyway. I also wish Google included a charger brick in the box, and that the phone came with those ""plastic"" screen protector things out-of-box so I didn't have to smudge fingerprints all over it before I got a case.",4,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" November 20, 2022",A. Amat,In place replacement? (questionable upgrade),"I gave it three stars for value for money because as we know phones tend to lower in price considerably from one month to another...I purchased this 6A to replace my beloved 2019 Motorola edge. I realized that waterfall screen phones may seem kind of a smirky passe gimmick these days...But if you have never held the ORIGINAL 2019 Motorola edge in hand you can't truly appreciate how beautiful that phone really is... It is nearly 90% screen with no side bezels a tiny forehead and a minuscule's chin.Specs wise, even though this 6A appears to be superior (barely)...in real world performance, this is not exactly the case...The moto edge's 765g is a surprisingly competent mid-range chip that rarely disappoints and often impresses.If I were to compare it with Google's own Tensor chip you'd be hard pressed to find any real world differences... In fact, as it's well known, Google's chip tends to run warmer and don't seem to be as power efficient...I have to be really honest in a direct spec wise comparison even though Google's pixel's specs are superior DO to being latest technology they don't seem to perform any better than the previous tech of other manufacturers.I have experienced the checklist of issues others have had with Google's pixel 6 phones.If I were to pick a particularly annoying one it's the infuriating poor fingerprint sensor, which is completely useless in full daylight and has trouble recognizing fingerprints from different angles... If I were to pick a percentage I would say that it fails 60% of the time... And as you can imagine that is abysmal compared to literally $150 phones that have more competent fingerprint readers.But it goes beyond that. I eventually decided to leave my beloved motto edge because I felt that it's current specs were causing me app misbehavior. (As well as it having a slightly cracked screen)But in truth, it seems that these bugs and mishaps were really related more to the apps themselves than they were to the phone.As this phone seems to suffer the same or similar hiccups...Even more bizarre is that most of these hiccups appear to be suffered by Google's own apps...It would take a book for me to describe all my dissatisfactions with the performance of this phone. So much so that I don't really see it so much as an upgrade as merely a replacement for a phone that I loved that was unfortunately outdated by time and made no sense to repurchase even though it was available at a superior price to this one.",4,B0B3PQPNKS,Color: Chalk | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" August 7, 2022",Nick Ateen,Don't buy.,"I looked at all of the component parts of this phone and knew that they were subpar. However, the only thing that truly intrigued me was the live translate. No other reason to buy this phone but for that feature. Guess what ? That feature is not ready for prime time and is nothing more than a con job marketing piece. It is basically inoperable. No wonder it is only available on pixel 6 phones because they need some stupid guinea pigs to buy and test this feature of their software so they can hopefully perfect future versions.Look at every feature of this phone. Cheap plastic, plug in non-wireless recharge, takes forever to charge the battery, no recharging cord, small screen, only 60 HZ, 6 gb ram etc. Essentially, a $200 phone that is $449.  I would recommend spending less than $200 and getting so much more with a Blu or Tcl phone. Don't let the Google stamp fool you.

" October 6, 2022",YT WangYT Wang,An excellent phone at an outstanding price,"I picked up this Pixel 6a to replace my aging Essential Phone (if anyone remembers those)... Needless to say, it's an excellent replacement. The Google Tensor chip is incredibly fast and its AI smarts (especially the Magic Eraser feature) are truly magical. Features like these are really what make Pixel devices stand out from the rest. (The excellent software experience is another pro in this regard.)The new camera bump design is quite attractive and undoubtedly distinctive. Those who have seen a Pixel 6 before will certainly know this is a Pixel 6-series device with just a glance.Although this device misses the glass back from the Pixel 6, I personally find this a worthy tradeoff - despite being a fairly large device (with a 6.1 inch diagonal display), it's actually noticeably lighter than the Essential Phone (which has a 5.7 inch diagonal display).Battery life, particularly while not connected to the cellular network, is also excellent. I can easily get 2 days of full-time, daily driver use - and 4-5 with the Extreme Battery Saver feature enabled. I don't need to worry about charging this phone every night.Overall, the Pixel 6a is absolutely a worthy replacement for my Essential Phone - not to mention, I was able to pick up a practically new one through Amazon Warehouse for around $290, which is less than I originally paid for the Essential Phone several years ago. I hope I'll be able to get another 5-6 years out of this phone, just as I did with the Essential Phone.",5,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" November 4, 2022",jm,"Good phone, hard to unlock","As others have noted, the fingerprint reader is not great. I upgraded from a 3a, and I really miss having a dedicated spot that I could press while my phone was still in my pocket, so that it was unlocked by the time I was looking at my phone. Now I have to get it out, find where I'm supposed to press, and sometimes try multiple times before it works. At best, it takes ~2 seconds longer to unlock than the 3a. I guess, in some ways, it's good to add a little friction to the process of unlocking my phone so maybe I'm less tempted to check it all the time?One big improvement from the 3a is that my hotspot appears to work much, much better. I spend an hour or so a day on the bus, so I like to get as much work done as I can. My 3a worked fine in this regard from 2019 up through the pandemic, but since I started going back to work in fall 2021, the hotspot no longer worked for about a quarter of my bus ride, and it often dropped unexpectedly, meaning I would sometimes lose work. So far, I haven't had any hotspot issues with the 6a. That alone makes it worth upgrading.As was expected, the performance feels much better. Apps and websites load a lot faster. I also like the wide angle lens.",4,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" October 23, 2022",Kyle,Most cost efficient smart phone out there,"Although there are some things that I dislike, this phone is definitely a buy if you are looking to change from old phones. This phone doesn't come with the specs of the high-end phones, but it is good enough for daily uses. Unless you are planning on playing games with heavy graphics or taking long (20+ mins) quality videos, this phone does the job.There are two things I do dislike about this phone.One is that its gyro censor is not very great. I like to watch youtube in bed, so I will flip my phone around to horizontal and vertical views a lot. Pixel 6a seems very slow or insensitive to the shifts and it will take couple times to get it to the right side.Second thing is that its finger print recognition is rather slow compared to other android phones.

" August 4, 2022",JJ,Returning this: Poor battery life and photos worse than Pixel 3a,"There are enough problems that I'm going to return this phone four days after I got it. Summary: Poor battery life, photos are inferior to the Pixel 3a I've been using, Tensor processor doesn't speed up what I do, not having the headphone jack is a bigger problem than I thought it'd be. Details next.Because Google is stopping security updates for the Pixel 3a, it's time for a new phone. I hoped the Google Tensor processor in the 6a would make the phone faster for things like Google's PhotoScan app that do a lot of processing. I haven't seen much difference. (I don't use the phone to play games.)One big problem is the battery life. For simple things like email, phone calls, and web browsing, the battery drains much more quickly than the 3a. (Note: I use the AccuBattery app to help save the battery by only charging to 80%. The app says this should more than double my battery life... and the 3a battery does seem to last as long as when the phone was new. I need to charge the 6a twice a day (no, I don't want the limits of Extreme Battery Saver).I'm sad that there's no headphone jack. I use a wired hands-free in my car to make phone calls, so things like Pixel Buds don't help me. I can get a USB dongle with a headphone/mic jack, but I'm not sure I can leave it in the car without it being fried by high summer temperatures... so I'm going to need to remember to carry it with me along with the phone, which is a real pain!I'm a serious photographer, and I'm disappointed in the camera. I'm glad it still saves RAW (DNG) files. The skin tones are a bit better than the 3a. The Night Sight photos have less color noise (""speckles"") in the RAW files than the 3a, but they're far too dark. Unlike the 3a, the 6a doesn't let me turn off HDR -- which I usually don't like because it can exaggerate colors. The 6a's JPG files can be really ugly, probably because they're sharpened more than they were in the 3a. To get really fine quality photos, I'd be editing lots of DNGs and saving them as JPG (or PNG) before I print them big.To show you the ugly sharpening in the JPGs, I'll attach small sections of two photos at 100% magnification. These are from Google's PhotoScan app of a painting by Georgia O'Keeffe. The one with smooth color is from the 3a; the one with the random patterns and strange-looking edges are from the 6a.I might try a Pixel 5a, but they cost almost the same new as a 6a! Also, Google has promised five years of software updates for the 6a, but the 5a only has two years left. So this may be my last Pixel. :(",2,B0B3PQPNKS,Color: Chalk | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone

It's the right size for me, too, especially if I have to hold it up to my ear for a long period of time. If this happens a lot in the future, I'll use my Bluetooth earphones.I did hear that the Jan 2023 update messed Bluetooth connectivity up a bit for use in cars. I'll be getting a car with this capability in a couple of months, so I hope that is resolved by then.Unlike my previous Pixel 3a, it's waterproof, has an updated OS with improved features (the pictures are better even though the camera is supposed to be the one used since the Pixel 2, the Android Assistant is really good, and the shortcuts are convenient -- and programmable! -- for the most-used features so one can pull the phone out and be taking pictures in about a second now) and it makes much better use of the available space for the screen. The response is noticeably better than the Pixel 3a, perhaps at the cost of the battery life. The 3a lasted at least a week for me, versus four or five days for the 6a.There were more initial problems with connection reliability than the 3a had, but the 3a didn't have 5G support. Maybe there are still growing pains with 5G. I note that the 4G 3a had consistent 4 bars where the 6a struggles to get 2 at the same location, but the phones would use WiFi more than cellular connections there. There may be some provider issues; I'm happy with the phone itself.I liked the earphone plug in the 3a, but strangely I don't miss the lack, and if that helps the waterproofing of the phone I'm all for it. The new phone recognizes its orientation much faster than the 3a did, even though I do not have the facial recognition feature enabled for this purpose.But I do miss the fingerprint sensor on the back of the phone. The one on the front embedded in the screen feels like a gimmick. It's slower to successfully recognize me, and seems faster at acknowledging failures. I did add my thumb this time; any other finger required two hands to log on to the phone. And maybe it is a security feature, but this OS requires a keypad code a lot more often than the Pixel 3a OS.The Android OS has continually improved safety features with each new version. I'm not happy that the OS will not be updated after three years, but I do like the five-year security support.",4,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" October 25, 2022",J. R. J. R. ,Great phone but poor quality,"This is my first Pixel phone and I new the 6a was a more affordable version and was plastic instead of glass like the regular 6 and 6 Pro. I don't mind it being plastic but I've only had the phone for a few days and the back already has micro scratches from the original Google case. I put it on once I received it this past Friday (oct 21st) and didn't take it off until right now, oct 25th, to do my review. I've tried wiping the back but you can feel the depth so those marks are definitely permanent. As for the Pixel experience, it does feel a lot snappier than my S10e but overall about the same as the iPhone 11 I returned to get this phone. The reason I sent back the iPhone 11 was because the camera on my S10e was better overall while taking pictures at sunrise or sunset and the Pixel is really good too. I'm actually really happy with the performance and the battery life but the cheap quality plastic used is a big disappointment. As for the heat issues I've read in other reviews, I haven't had any problem other than the first 15-20 minutes it took to copy everything from my S10e. Overall I'd say i like the phone but now I'm considering returning it and buying the regular 6 or maybe even the 7 just for the build quality.",4,B0B3PQPNKS,Color: Chalk | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
"Reviewed in Canada 🇨🇦 on September 8, 2022",LuckyLucyLuckyLucy,best in mid-tier class phone/camera/clean android,"Pixel 6a Cell Phone - CharcoalWriting this review on sept 2022 timeframe.  Bought two while it is on sale 50$ off.This is basically the BEST Cleanest clutter free android you can buy for 550$CAD.  It certainly has competition but simply put,  non Pixel phones are cluttered with bloatware.  The only phones in mid-tier that comes close are some offerings by motorola however i am continually disappointed in Camera performance for all motorola phones both in low light and with the speed of taking the shot.  With FAST updates and Android support ,  I think you should not look further and buy this phone.Folks complain about glass fingerprint sensor -- i do think it's improved quite a bit from all the updates.  Sept 2022 update also improves upon this.  If you have a front glass protector, you should enable the high sensitivity mode if necessary.  I personally have the Caseology glass protector and have no issues.  It performs on par with my old samsung note 10+ glass sensor.Battery life is average... nothing great.  Gets me through the day.Camera is basically the best on the Android  market at this price in my opinion.  I've used mid-tier  Samsung., Motorola, TCL, Huawei, Plus one.. .  theyre all strong contenders but I always preferred the photos coming out of Google camera with its computational photography.  It keeps getting better with updates and Google doesnt abandon the phone for 2-3 years after buying.  Other manufacturers are ""one and done"" and once you get the phone, its RARE to have any improvements (based on my own observations whilst owning those phones)A few things i wouldve liked to see:--I generally would have LOVED to have the wired earphone connector on ALL phones but alas, pixel has gone the way of Bt only (or usb adapters).--I'm also going to say I'm not super thrilled with glass back.  The phone NEEDS a case otherwise its slippery and fragile. .-- only offered in 128GB flash .  would have liked one of the two phones i bought , to have 256.  Of course Google phones never offer external SD card.Despite a few qualms I had,  I still consider this phone best in class.------------update:well? i love this device what can i say.  i ended up waiting for sales on this device AND/OR warehouse units.  BEST bang for buck  device in 2023 imo still.  Got THREE  now --  at around 300-350 per device, pixel google clean android experience. great price to spent on kids phones.",4,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" September 25, 2022",TLK-KC,I like it,"I replaced a Google Pixel 4a with the 6a when my 4a wouldn't charge. The 6a has many similar features as the 4a, but they slightly changed a few things so that you have to search for the feature. I still tap the back of the phone looking for the fingerprint recognition spot. However, the screen spot does work 95% of the time. The 5G speed is nice and worked well internationally as well. The one complaint I have is that the battery life is well below the level that my 4a had. When my 4a quit charging, the battery life was still over 3 days per charge. The 6a battery life will last a day, but not 2 or 3 days. I liked the Google Pixel enough to buy another one.

" November 29, 2022",Joe T.,Thoughts from a Motorola Fanboy,"I have been a long time Motorola Fanboy when it comes to cell phones as their price and features tend to be unmatched.  I decided to roll the dice on this Pixel 6A and unfortunately, I wish I would have stayed with Motorola.  Let me explain....  My BIGGEST ISSUE with this phone is the finger print sensor.  Simply put it is trash.  Other reviewers said Google had fixed this, however, this has not been the case.  (full disclosure - I do use a screen protector)  Upon searching for a fix to this problem, I read that you need to buy a $50 google approved screen protector.  That's ridiculous.  For this reason alone, I would not buy this phone.  You will need to type in your pin number 95% of the time you interact with the phone.  ...Trust me - it gets annoying!  especially in the car while you are driving.  Also there is NO FACIAL RECOGNITION so don't go thinking that is an option.  My other problem with this phone is I cannot use a dongle for plugging into a non-bluetooth device.  Whenever I do, I get a message saying ""not provisioned or supported"" or something like that.  Aside from those issues this phone does have some positives.  Their notifications is on par with Motorola.  The battery life is good.  The phones speakers are nice and loud.  The camera is phenomenal and way ahead of Motorola.  I was a bit concerned about buying a phone with Google's proprietary chipset, but it has been good.  No issues there.  Hopefully this review helps you if you are on the fence in making a decision.",3,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" September 29, 2022",Kay Marie ,Good phone!!,"The media could not be loaded.�It's all in all a pretty nice phone! Now I'm coming from Google pixel 5 which I won't sugar coat I absolutely hated! I only had the 5 because I broke my Google pixel 4a which I loved, the 5 was all around a horrible phone, the battery didn't even last half the day, like I literally always had to be around a charger, the phone felt hollow and cheap, just all around I hated that phone, but I absolutely loved the 4a the picture quality the battery life it was a nice budget phone. So I decided I was over the 5 and wanted to get the next budget phone and went with the sage green Google pixel 6a and I've had it now for a couple days and so far Im really enjoying the experience! It's a nice slick phone looks like it could be an expensive phone, the picture quality I already can tell is awesome, the battery lasts me all day I won't have to plug it in until I'm going to bed at night and I use it none stop literally the entire day listening to YouTube and podcasts while scrolling through social media, and shopping online. I only experienced the phone getting real hot and over heating the first day I received it, but I was doing a lot of stuff on it along with downloadong system updates and charging it all at the same time, so it did over heat and was moving real slow. I easily was able to fix that by stopping everything I was doing, stopping the downloads and letting the phone rest on charge for awhile and once it charged I started everything back up with it off charge and it was fine. Since then I haven't had any issues with it getting hot. The finger print reader isn't the best... That does get a little frustrating but doesn't change my over all feelings about the phone. Now before I had any Google phones I was a big android fan, I've given iphones a shot and just couldn't get into the limitations of the iPhones, but loved what they offered in picture quality I went to Google pixel because I wanted to try them all, got the pixel budget phone and felt like the picture quality was comparable to iphone while still having the android freedom and the price point was perfect (I break phones far to much to keep spending money on overly expensive phones). After trying the pixel I couldn't go back. I am now a big Google pixel fan! Are there things Google needs to do better on? Yes of course they definitely need to improve some things but over all for the price , the picture quality (which is a big deal for me, I love taking pictures!) and the over all feel of the phone you really can't beat it! I would recommend to everyone to give pixels a shot and the 6a is a good phone to try! 🖤",4,B0B3Q23BT4,Color: Sage | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone

" August 18, 2022",catgrrl,Second time's the charm,"I have never been someone who spends more than $100 on a phone and I tend to keep them long after most people have upgraded. So when I decided to get this phone (at $449 with a $50 gift card, nice deal) I was taking a big step. When it stopped having service within 12 hours I wasn't happy. I was able to contact Amazon for an exchange in the hopes I just got a lemon and so far, a week later, the replacement is working awesome. I haven't updated Adaptive Connectivity Service because with the first phone that's when things went wonky, and while it could be a coincidence (and likely is since even a factory reset didn't fix the connectivity problem) I don't want to chance it (and from reviews it looks like that app is less than useful anyway). I take a lot of photos and I love the software features for that (magic eraser is pretty magical).It's not top-of-the-line but for $399 I wasn't expecting a Samsung Galaxy 22, so I happy - or at least I'm happy with the second phone!",4,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" September 8, 2022",DX,Some improvements but missteps,"There's already been a lot said about this phone so this will cover what I've found to be good and bad after using it since launch.Coming from a 3a, this was a smoother and better looking experience. The size is almost perfect and the feel is better. The 6 pro looks better sure, but the 6a isn't bad. The storage is still bad and of course you can't add a SD card to expand it! This is probably my biggest issue with phones today, they lock you out of expanded storage!!! Also, you can't get aftermarket batteries! Also Google reduced how many versions you're guaranteed and now offer less than other manufacturers on their own OS! So three strikes already!The other issue is the software, android 12. I haven't rooted in a long time and this has made me do it again. I upgraded my 3a to A12 and I still was able to take screenshots by holding the power button that gave me the option to take one. It was extremely nice and better than the ""hold power and volume down"". What did A12 do.... Go back to the two-button screenshot! What a dumb thing to do.The next problem is the swipe back feature, you can't disable the right side. Seriously, what is wrong with the devs? It's like they keep giving people less and less options. It's so screwed up and the bad thing is you don't find out until you buy it because reviewers can't or often don't mention these things because sometimes what bothers ""you"" won't bother themOne last issue is Google seems to be moving some photos editing tools away from the free app that's installed on the phone and onto their paid service. This is once again why I hate so many companies today, they nickel and dime you while taking away what was once part of something offered at no additional cost.One more thing, sometimes the phone hangs when switching between apps or your stuck with an empty screen with only your background. This never happened on my 3a.Overall, it's an okay upgrade over the 3a but if it wasn't for the slightly better storage (cough), and getting a good deal on it, this is not a great upgrade. Too many issues with the software (back steps and the like), and lack of battery/storage upgrades. Google isn't alone in the latter, it's a trend by almost all the phone makers today which is wrong.",3,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" September 10, 2022",Captain Bob,Great Replacement for my Pixel 4A 5G,"This is an upgrade of my Pixel 4A 5G. It came charged. Hooked up the supplied cable from my old phone to the 6A. The transfer was super easy and didn't take all that long. I was worried about some of the reviews I had read but decided to give it a shot any way. I love the new phone. The in screen fingerprint reader WORKS GREAT!!! I used it all day long and put it on the charger when I went to bed. No problems. Overall, this is the perfect upgrade. It looks and works like my 4A but I like the idea of the new Tensor chip with upgraded security. Best part, I got it with my Capital One rewards. It didn't come with a charger but charged fine on my quick charger for my ThinkPad and then the next day overnight with USB charging. I highly recommend this phone. Pictures and videos are very good. I like the upgraded software for photo editing. Got the Nineasy [3 in 1] case with kickstand. The buttons are a little stiff but hopefully will ease up some with use. Also came with a screen protector but I'm not using it. My phone was unlocked. Using it on Consumer Cellular. I'm an old fart and am home most of the time so I use my wifi for data most of the time.

" December 18, 2022",Chris H.,"Decent hardware, but no wall charger included","I picked two of these up for my parents, their ""old"" phones started acting up. I've had great luck with my Pixel 4a, so i decided to stick to that lineage and go with these 6as,Hardware is a quantum leap over their old phones, the under-screen fingerprint reader seems to work quite well, and the sim tray is easy to remove and install, even if you may need to pop the sim removal tool under an edge of the slide in order to get the tray out.So far it's great, but there's one big problem: No wall charger in the box anymore.  It comes with the USB-C cable, and the adapter to transfer from your old phone to the new one, but if you're upgrading from Micro-USB, Lightning, or older styles,  you're gonna have to pick up USB-A to USB-C adapters to re-use chargers with USB ports on them, or spend extra on a USB-C charger. Paying a couple of hundred dollars for a phone you cant charge out of the box is an added annoyance that i could really do without.If you're upgrading from a USB-C phone, or have chargers already from newer laptops/tablets, the rest of the Pixel 6a is outstanding, especially the camera. But if you're coming from something older, go and pick up a USB-C charger as well, along with a case.",4,B0B3PQPNKS,Color: Chalk | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone

" December 23, 2022",Amazon Customer,I returned it for the Pixel 7--more RAM; better processing,"I tried to go budget with the 6a 128gb, but then I was dropping calls like it was the '90s; I had a 100% fail rate three calls in. After dialing *611, two transfers and like... 45 minutes, Verizon said it was because my sim card from my old phone was ""incompatible,"" and they just remotely kicked me and my new phone off their network because they are incompetent. That gave me some time to reflect on the fact that I just needed more room and I /really/ didn't mind switching carriers for a locked phone deal and a sparkly new compatible sim.I'm happy with my decision because I tend to leave lots of apps running and have lots of tabs in chrome, and even brand new, the 6a had a little trouble managing that. In particular, the developer options section in settings would lag and freeze, even when I was just scrolling through and had closed most other apps.If you put your phone through a lot, consider going with the 7 or better for the processing capabilities. The only thing I preferred about the 6a was the slightly smaller size; I have smallish hands and it fit them better.Also... if you're trying to decide whether to move your physical sim from your old phone or to download an e-sim, you should probably just go the e-sim route. Once I had a new sim (my new carrier sent me a physical one, so I just used that despite my younger sister's disdainful laugh at the thought), the Pixel 7 handled phone calls perfectly.",4,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone

I have used glass back devices in the past but this one is at a different level. You have to hold it in your hand to feel how premium this is. Especially, the white one is stunning.Display - Good. But the color saturation is much underwhelming compared to my previous phone. (Asus zenfone 5z). 60 hz refresh rate is not of much concern to me. The phone functions quite smoothly. Animations are great.Battery - Back up is very good. You can easily use the for phone for a complete day with 30 - 20% power remaining. Charging is slow though. Heating issue is almost nonexistent after the update.Sound - Sound is awesome. Adequately loud and deep. Stereo effect is remarkable.Camera - Outstanding feature of this phone. Though I am not too much into photography the pictures and videos I have taken came out really well.Software experience - The best I have experienced so far. Very satisfying.Fingerprint sensor - This must be the weakest point of this phone. A physical rear fingerprint sensor would have been much better than the below average in-display sensor. Gets frustrating at times.One word to describe the experience would be 'satisfying'. The sound, display and the stock android OS together take the user experience to another level.

Adapter that comes with it is the wrong sex to use with USB 3 electrical socket and supplied cable.  You would think Google wouldn't want you to regret the purchase because you have no way to charge even before setup.  Google claims everyone should have had a plug like this already.

" August 7, 2022",nagarjuna,Best phone I have owned!,"I lost my Xiaomi phone and preordered the 6a. This is my 1st. Experience with a pixel phone and let me tell you I am in love with it already !!!! Never will purchase a Samsung or apple phone, I just don't do those certain things. Back to Google's latest phone release, I am excited (which I rarely get these days) when I hit the finger print reader because I correctly setup the finger print reader prior to using it. there is NO issues with any of  the  pixel 6 series finger print sensors. The only issues are pixel 6 series finger print readers are so accurate of how your finger prints were setup/recorded up prior to using the sensor that  if your finger prints are too moist, or your finger prints contain residue on them such as oil build-up from eating something and not washing your hands, or handling something dirty and not washing your hands and drying your finger prints thoroughly will cause the finger print sensors to REJECT the recognition of your finger prints upon trying to unlock your phone.  So the best thing you need to do prior to setting up your finger print sensor reader  on ANY pixel 6 series phone is too throughly wash and dry your hands prior to setting up your Pixel 6 series finger print sensors. That way the finger print sensors on the initial setup will have your finger prints at their most cleanest and driest state to ensure accurate reading of your finger prints doing the set-up/recording of your finger prints and for the reading of your finger print after the initial setup. The only time I experience error in the finger print sensor is when my hands are dirty, oily , or too moist. And the finger print sensors will ALWAYS deny me access if my finger prints are not thoroughly clean and dry as to how they were prior to setting up the finger print reader sensory. another mention about the Pixel 6a series is the (sound amplifier) app. It will greatly enhance your listening experience with earbuds or just the phone speakers themselves so try it out and become amazed.  To sum it up , the Pixel 6a with the new google earbuds I received with the pre-order is the best deal I have scored so far this year and I am very grateful to own a Pixel 6a phone. So I will now upgrade to every Google Pixel  flagship release starting with the Pixel 7 release. I am sure I will get a good trade-in price for this Pixel 6a being it won't be 6 months old when the Pixel 7 is Released.

Comparing Pixel 6a and 4a, the 4a has 5-10 db stronger cell tower signal reception compared to Pixel 6a.

" January 25, 2023",JDR,Almost Flagship Phone,"As a preface I did buy this Pixel 6a from Amazon at an amazing budget phone price.  I have a  still functioning Moto G7 that other than the camera I thought was a way better bargain but wasn't supported by Motorola anymore.  This Pixel 6a is almost a flagship phone that has what some would consider drawbacks but in many opinions other than mine is a great little phone.  My logic in purchasing it is as follows.  It's a Google phone and the Android OS is theirs and it is as clean as can be with the latest Android 13 on it and it's going to be supported for at least 4 years with timely updates.  It's battery life is good, reception and audio very good and it has a sharp Old display and plenty responsive.  The camera combined with the Google software rivals the best and it has a fast processor and more than adequate onboard memory for most people.  I like the size of the phone since I am not a large person and the screen is plenty large for me.  Games and videos do well on it as it is fine for all but the most very demanding ones.  And it is not overly heavy, fits in to a pocket and is well made.  For some there are disadvantages such as no wireless charging, no macro or telephoto or wide-angle camera lenses, and although water resistant not 30 minute type and the response is an ok 60hz .  But such features require more than twice as much as I paid for it and some of the more expensive phones ""features"" don't perform that well.

It's basically the same experience. 60Hz screen I noticed at first but now it's no problem at all, it's the smoothest 60Hz I have used. Battery life is way better and it lasts me the whole day. One time it managed to get 12hrs of screen on time.Cameras in good lighting is basically the same. It's at night I notice the difference.

" August 2, 2022",Hunter,"Solid effort from Google, battery is interesting though.","So first off for phones in this price range in the United States, this is the best performance you're going to find. The tensor chip is a beast and this phone is buttery smooth to use. The amount of features that Google has crammed into this device is wonderful, tons of useful things that are pixel exclusive and make everyday use a joy. The only drawback I have is the battery. The battery life itself is average but the worst thing is the charge times, this is easily the slowest charging phone I have had in the last 5 to 10 years. I don't think that the slow charging should detract you from buying it because it is a great phone but I think Google definitely could have worked a little harder to optimize that part of the phone.Update: The slow battery charging speeds are what they are but the battery life is actually better than I first gave it credit for. I believe that during the first week or so of using the phone the adaptive battery feature learns your usage patterns and adapts to them to provide a better experience. I still would have liked to have seen a 5000 mah battery in this phone but if you owned a Samsung S20 FE 5g I find the battery life to be very similar to that device.

During set up , it drained faster then my bank account. Even after a full 8 hours of charging using the type c charger it came with it only charged to 46 percent.2. The Phone runs perm hot. Like, Hot hot. Even when not in use. ( ( I made use unused apps were closed and only nesessary apps were running)3. The camera straight sucks! The camera on my moto G8 is leagues better and even has a professional photography mode giving me more controller 5o better take clear, non-pixalated photos.4. Would not connect to WiFi. Like, any WiFi at all5. I use Google Fi and one would think their phone service would run preem on their o2n Google device but NOPE! On my moto G8 I would have in-between 4-full bars with the occasional 3 bars signal in certain areas. With pixel, one bar only. Even after multiple resets and even multiple factory resets.6. Could not connect anything Bluetooth to this phone7. The speakers are loud but other than volume up and down , no other audio controls such as bass, treble, or presets like, rock, classical ...etc.All in all, I was genuinely excited to get this phone as I have been interested in pixel phones for some time and have been into motos for yeeeears now and after this, I will stick with motos.

I added several fingerprints when I first set it up and when they weren't working, I deleted them all and tried again to be more intentional about how I place each print and angle... Still nothing. The fingerprint reader is pointless. If I could give it negative stars I would have.I also drive an older car that doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities and the 6a doesn't have a headphone jack. I will never understand why that caught on with phone makers... So now I'm off to buy an adapter unless I want to wear my Bluetooth earbuds the whole time I'm driving.

The phone is packed with features, had 5G connectivity, great processor, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. There is no SD slot, so you can't add storage, but for some that's not an issue: you can upload photos to Google Photos or Amazon Photos. I did have a problem with the phone heating up quite a lot, but found you can disable 5G and the LTE setting works just fine, I couldn't tell the difference. That was before the Android 13 update. With that update things seem better with the heating up, but I'm leaving 5G disabled for the time being. The PIxel launcher doesn't include tap-to-close screen, you have to use the power button and that's a drag. However, you can install a free app that allows the feature (an essential for me), or switch to a launcher that allows it. There doesn't seem to be a way to turn on or off fast charging, but the phone does have adaptive battery feature that seems ok  right now.

" September 1, 2022",Kellyn,Absolutely garbage phone,"Google does a lot of things right, but this phone is absolute garbage for so many reasons, which I will list in order of worst to least.Service:This phone cuts out service for HOURS with no fix. Airplane mode, safe mode reset, rebooting. Nothing works. These are the same areas I've used my previous phone with the same sim card and had no problems. I've been downtown in a major city and gotten no service and I can literally see a cell tower from where I'm standing.Switching between WiFi and data: I have caught this phone several times using data instead of WiFi even when it's actively connected with no issues. It downloaded an 8 GB file via data when I was in my home, connected to my wifi and burned through a month's worth of data in 20 mins.Interface:If you use the default launcher, you are forced to have a Google search bar on the bottom of all of your home screens. This is not optional. You will also have a permanent widget called At A Glance that can technically be removed, but the space the widget occupied is blocked off so you will just have a portion of unavailable screen space.The app drawer cannot be modified. It will display all apps in alphabetical order. You cannot have folders or hide icons.The recent apps background is also just plain gray. No blurred see through to your background. Just boring, plain gray.Your default screen must be the first screen. You cannot have any home screens to the left of the main one.Charging: while the battery life is good and my phone does not typically die during the day, the perhaps biggest detriment is that this phone does not come with a charger! And what's more, the transfer cable you're given is usb-c to usb-c, which means you cannot even use an existing charger brick you may already have. You have to go buy a new third party one!! How stupid is that??All in all, I've had this phone for a little over a month and it's just not worth it at all.

These are the things that I hate about this phone, after absolutely loving the Pixel 4a:-No headphone jack-Fingerprint reader was moved from back of phone into the actual screen of the phone, and it is extremely frustrating and ineffective. It rarely reads my fingerprints on the first try, so Google has effectively thrown me back to 2013, using a pin every time to open my phone.-Battery is only marginally better. DOES NOT LAST 24 HOURS for regular use.-Front Camera was better when it was in the top left corner. I dislike having it glaring at me from the top middle of my screen.-They got rid of limitless digital photo memory/storage.-The speakers SUCK. I don't know what they did, but these speakers are absolutely terrible compared to even the 4a.-5g feels slower than 4g, but it may be my service provider.Here are the notable improvements:-60hz refresh rate is genuinely good.-The screen feels more responsive, and overall the menu and app navigation feels faster and things load more smoothly.-The screen size of the 6a is preferable to the 4a, it feels better in your hands.-The haptic rumbles have been improved slightly.I'll give them credit where credit is due, it is a decent phone for the price.

I've had no issues with the speed, display or memory on the phone. I don't believe the battery life is as long as they say. It usually lasts about five to six hours if I use it to stream video. One annoyance I have is the location of the speakers. When I hold my phone, my finger covers one of them, muting the phone and buzzing my finger. When I put a case on the phone, it helped somewhat with that though. Overall very pleased with it.",4,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" August 10, 2022",afaik,A Disappointment,"A phone experience depends a lot on which old phone you have had. I have just upgraded from pixel 4a to this 6a, and I am not glad. First, the 6a is pretty heavier, it is a bit larger, but that is somehow fine. The signal reception is poorer, the sound quality is averagely good. The fingerprint scanner on the screen does not respond sometimes and is irritating. The phone lacks a 3.5 sound port. The best experience I have had with pixel series is thus far with 3a then 4a, but I am afraid this 6a is the last for me with pixel.

" October 27, 2022",A-aron,"Phone is fine(nothing special), Google customer service is atrocious","My wife and I both bought these phones for 400 and 450 respectively. The phones work fine and are nice (though I preferred the smaller form factor of the 4a). 3 weeks after we bought them, they dropped the price to 300. I called to get a price adjustment and they said no. I bought the phones a couple days after they were released and they dropped the price 3 weeks after it was released. They refused to give a price adjustment which I view as punishing early adopters. I get it if the phone was years old or if it was even a month out of purchase.Also, I have been using Nexus and Pixel phones since they came out. They've all been fine and the only reason why I haven't switched to Apple is because Apple annoys me. But, the horrible customer service and lack of empathy towards long-time customers may change my mind. Maybe I'm being a whiney customer, but I think it's a reasonable ask to get even a single price adjustment... Once again... Maybe I'm wrong. Either way, apple will likely be getting my money moving forward",1,B0B3Q23BT4,Color: Sage | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone

" February 8, 2023",djla,Google's worst yet,"I swore last time I bought a Google phone I was never getting suckered again, but there was a holiday promotion and the price was right and... Idiot!My Pixel 6A has major charging issues, and judging from what's online, I'm not alone. Since the 6a doesn't do wireless charging, it means being tethered to a charging cord several hours a day. Today for example, I've been charging for 12 hours and have managed to go from 23% to 49% battery. No cord, including the original that came with the phone seems to satisfy the 6A.  Meanwhile, the rest of my devices have fully charged again. The 6A is at less than half, not a fully charged phone. I closed everything down, restarted the 6a, walked away an hour ago then came back to find that the percentage dropped from 42% to 36% charged, though still connected to the charger.The fingerprint reader which is now on the front of the phone, the glass screen, rarely works. This is a problem for me, as I have issues with my hands shaking, and therefore typing passwords or pin codes is problematic. Being able to place a finger on a print reader is much more efficient and less painful. However, Google's reader on the front of the phone correctly reads the print maybe 1 time in 3, even trying multiple fingers doesn't improve that average.There's a myriad of other weaknesses, problems and complaints, but in total it makes perfect sense that almost every action is interrupted by an inane prompt explaining the most basic operations of the phone.  Google figures that this is a phone for losers, so if you were dumb enough to buy this mess, you should be dealt with and talked to like the complete freakin' idiot you are.'Alexa, buy me an iPhone.""",1,B0B3Q23BT4,Color: Sage | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone
" February 3, 2023",Skye N.,Worst Pixel generation ever.,"Let me start by saying I've had nothing but Pixel phones since the first Pixel came out and I've loved them all, besides this one. I've had this phone for ~4 months now and I've been hoping for an update that fixes all these issues but now I'm giving up hope. I'll start by listing all the negatives...- The screen unlock finger print works about 30% of the time, even when I redo the finger print several times a month. I miss the old style with the spot on the back that worked 95% of the time.- The camera is super slow to take pictures and process. Picture quality is great when you have the 5 seconds to sit there and wait though.- The navigation loses GPS signal all the time and for no apparent reason. Incredibly frustrating when you're relying on it and then it just dies and doesn't know where you are.- The swipe texting is terrible with giving the correct words. I never had this issue on the previous Pixel phones. I've had to correct the words 15+ times so far for this review.- Some of my apps I can't get to give me any kind of audible or vibrating notifications for some reason.- Sometimes the phone just decides to not have any volume for anything and I have to reboot it.Those are just the top things I can think of. This is by far the worst phone I've ever owned and my wife Pixel 6 is just as bad.

" September 3, 2022",Smith,Disappointing.,"I really wanted to like this phone. The AI tricks up Google's sleeve is impressive. Instant speech recognition, call screening, the computational photography, all are great. But when it comes to being a phone, it just kinda sucks at it.I use Mint Mobile, which uses T-Mobile towers. Across a variety of other devices, I've had outstanding service with it, 5 bars all around, excellent 5G speeds, etc. So I know it's not Mint. This phone consistently and frequently disconnects from service, entirely. It'll be 5G full bars one moment, and absolutely nothing the next. It'll stay like that until I reboot the phone. I just can't use this phone *as a phone* if it's disconnecting when out in the field, ya know?Also, the battery life just sucks. It has 18W slow charging, and battery drains quicker than anything else I've ever used. I barely got an 8 hour work day in before leaving with 16% battery remaining. My previous Samsung never dropped below 70%.I'm not sure what google has been doing all this time, but they really need to fix this crap. AI is cool but it's useless if the phone is dead or can't connect to towers. Very disappointed.",2,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone

" on February 10, 2023",Sangsaptak Bagchi,Long term review,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I AM USING A PREMIUM PHONE, SO EXPECT ME TO ACT ACCORDINGLY.I have been using this phone for more than one month so, it's going to be a detailed review.First I'd like to discuss the cons of the product which are few & can be easily ignored because its pros outnumber them heavily.Cons- 1. As it supports only 20 W charging, it takes around 2 hours to get this fully charged. If you're shifting from trendy fast charging phones that get the juice for the day within an hour, you'll have some difficulty at the beginning. I normally charge my phone in the morning after waking up before heading to office. So, it has done good in my life by reducing my unnecessary screen time in the morning.2. Battery life is not that great. I'm a moderate user. I leave it at 35-40% every night before going to sleep, but wake up to find it has dropped below 20% in the next morning. If you're a heavy user, you might have to get the juice twice a day.3. There is only one SIM slot. So, you have to opt for an eSIM for your secondary SIM.4. Accessories aren't easily available in the local market. If you're planning to go for this device, it is advised to buy all the essential accessories like Back cover, Screen Protector altogether because you'll have a  hard time finding them in the local market.That's it for the cons. Now coming to the amazing part-1. First of all, this comes with the Brand value of a Tech Giant like Google. That means this device is free from all unnecessary bloatwares, advertisements that come pre-installed with most of the devices. The UI experience is great.2. The cameras are killers. This is the first time I found both front & rear cameras equally powerful. Photography is good, videography is even better, stabilization is great. If you like making videos, you'll start looking for opportunities to take this thing out of your pocket to shoot.To sum it up, I must say if you're interested in a premium phone that comes with a Brand value of Google & you don't have a budget for iPhone or other Flagships, there is no other option other than this device.",5,B0B3PSRHHN,Color: Charcoal | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone

" March 16, 2023",H. W. Park,Better WiFi and Bluetooth reception,"I replaced my Pixel 4a (and my wife's) with this Pixel 6a.  I was having battery life issues on my 4a and when I looked up the end of support date for software updates, it was about 6 months out at the time. So it didn't make sense to replace the battery.I rated the the 6a as 4 because my observation of the battery life has been that is OK, but doesn't live up the the hype.What I have discovered that I really like is that the 6a phones reception of my WiFi signal is much better than the 4a phones.  With the 4a I could step on to my front an back porches and still have the WiFi.  With the 6a phones, I can go 100 to 150 feet from the house before loosing the WiFi connection.  This ability will allow me to work in the yard without using mobile cell data.On the Bluetooth feature, I have Shokz OpenRun Pro bone conduction ""ear"" buds.  When I got those, I found that my old ear buds had a connection range of about 30' with Shokz ear buds the range was about 50' - 60'. While a good thing, a disadvantage of the increased range was that I had further to go back to my desk if I wanted the connection further away, but still in the house particularly on the floor above.  With my 6a  phone, I get a good Bluetooth connection from my desk in the corner of the 1st floor to the diagonal corner on the 2nd floor.",4,B0B3PQPNKS,Color: Chalk | Style: Pixel 6a only,Google,Smart Phone

I've had great luck with my Pixel 4a, so i decided to stick to that lineage and go with these 6as,Hardware is a quantum leap over their old phones, the under-screen fingerprint reader seems to work quite well, and the sim tray is easy to remove and install, even if you may need to pop the sim removal tool under an edge of the slide in order to get the tray out.So far it's great, but there's one big problem: No wall charger in the box anymore.  It comes with the USB-C cable, and the adapter to transfer from your old phone to the new one, but if you're upgrading from Micro-USB, Lightning, or older styles,  you're gonna have to pick up USB-A to USB-C adapters to re-use chargers with USB ports on them, or spend extra on a USB-C charger. Paying a couple of hundred dollars for a phone you cant charge out of the box is an added annoyance that i could really do without.If you're upgrading from a USB-C phone, or have chargers already from newer laptops/tablets, the rest of the Pixel 6a is outstanding, especially the camera.

" April 8, 2022",R. Klein,what's not to like?,"This is my 2nd Samsung Ultra 5G. My first was the Samsung S20 Ultra 5G which I purchased in 2019. It is still in tip-top shape and I took pains not to let a blemish or a scratch onto it. Then I recently purchased the S22 Ultra 5G model. The difference is like riding in a Corvette and then a Lamborghini. This is a ridiculously advanced cell phone. Think about this: this single cell phone has almost a thousand times the power and several thousand times the digital capability of the computer(s) that Apollo11's Eagle lander used to land itself on the moon. It is very fast; it incorporates several advanced features. Best of all, Samsung decided to bring back the ""digital pen"" it included with its tablets. It fits unobtrusively on the bottom of the phone and its handiness and worth as a digital adjunct I'm only now beginning to appreciate. The S22 Ultra 5G is a twin-sim card capable phone; meaning you can have two distinct numbers the phone will respond to, making it a true dual-use phone (although why anyone would want to share a phone of this caliber with anybody else is questionable). The cameras on this phone rival the best digital cameras you could purchase as a discreet unit from any of the major digital camera technologies. The ""burst"" setting on the camera can knock of dozens of pictures in the time it takes you to blink your eye. It will take me years to explore every aspect of this phone's camera capabilities. The pictures are razor sharp. Cell reception is unparalleled. The unit sits comfortably in your palm because it is not weighty. Personally, I prefer to use noise-canceling wired earbuds when using this unit telephonically rather than holding it to my ear. Despite its almost out-of-range pricing schedule, this is a device worth every cent of its cost. If you decide to go for it, here's my opinion: always go for the 512GB or the 1TB model. You will not regret having the larger storage capability, especially if you use your camera to take video clips.

At least admit you're increasing margin by not including them in the phone package and then also making more money by forcing people to buy them separately.",5,B09MW13RQH,Color: Phantom Black | Size: 512GB | Style: S22 Ultra,Samsung,Smart Phone
" May 10, 2022",Jacob,great phone With l ittle missing S22 ultra 512Gb12gbram,"I Was waiting for this phone to go on sale and  it has  right before mothers day. I ended up getting the S22 uItra 512 Gb12gb ram phantom black version for only 1200 usd. I mainly waited for a sale because I think the two 128gb or 256 gb options would not fit my needs I needed at least 500gb  also 8gb ram is notenough either. 12 gb is noticably faster such as task for ing the S pen and multi Tasking. The 5000 battery is also great an vantage over the S22 +. As well as the 40mp front Camera and 108mp rear. the 512 Gb Storage/12 gb ram upgrade Was Well worth $1200 - the  original price of the S22 ultra 8 Gb ram with 128Gb storage was the same price as  the version I got when not on sale. overall So I am happy I waited.snd I suggest anyone looking to buy this to get it on sale.Now for some cons to report. Of course there is no.aux port, but it is 2022 ~ there is Wonderful Usb-c to aux port adapters that work just as well if not better quality depending on the adaptor.. was hoping Samsung would include one with the phone that I paid 1200 Plus USD for..Another issue is the Screen  can get micro ScratcheS from just being in your Pocket I highly Suggest you get a  Screen Protector  on Same day you get the phone to Prevent  Scratches on display.. anotherso, Isthatthe phone Is s slightly  heavy.. great performance and fast phone though I highly recommend it if you have the money.

It uses the snapdragon 8 gen 1 which appears to work perfectly for demanding tasks such as hard-core gaming , multi tasking or even multi windows running simultaneously,  I personally haven't experienced 0 lags or stutters.▪︎security is top tier !! It's secured by Samsung Knox, has a secured folder, fingerprint reader(in screen) and facial recognition (along with all the other standard security options) the fingerprint works perfectly no issues.▪︎self diagnose,  the phone can self diagnose and test to make sure all the services are working properly.▪︎ it's a Samsung! With Samsung it offers so many features, including free on-demand and live TV with over 100 channels, it has loads of unique features and services, a few examples are Bixby which is both an assistant and a toll for automated tasks, you also get loads of automation with the device for various tasks to help make your device more convenient.There's much more to mention but that's what came to mind, over all if you're looking for a premium phone and want a high-quality device , this phone definitely gets the job done by far with no issues, I'd highly advise a phone case as this phone is not cheap.Love it!",5,B09MW13RQH,Color: Phantom Black | Size: 512GB | Style: S22 Ultra,Samsung,Smart Phone

I have tried to stay away from Samsung due to two reasons they kept making phones long and skinny and put on a lot of bloatware.  When I held this phone in my hands and compare it to the Note 3(I still own it) and my One Plus 8pro, I knew I had to have it.  Despite the bloatware that you cannot uninstall, the phone feels great in my semi large hands.  The screen as with all Samsung flagship phones it outstanding, the battery last all day (5am-11pm) with pretty heavy use. (not gaming just setting up all my apps, watching You tube, surfing the internet)  I was a little concerned that the camera would not take night photos (astrophotography) as well as my One Plus 8 pro but I found it to be just as good maybe a little better.

It is the only reason why I got this phone and I am definitely not disappointed.If you do not care about the camera quality, there is no reason to get this phone. There are way better options out there. Samsung has lost its way by following Apple fanboys dream in removing the expandable SD card and charging customers upfront significantly more for internal memory and not even providng a charger? These are reason why I didn't buy apple's junk in the first place. But let's try to be fair...Is the internal memory worth the price then? Short answer is no - Just a marketing gimmick. How about the charger? Keep the cost down maybe? At this price range I think they can afford to throw in the charger. Maybe keep electronic waste down? Now people gotta go through a bunch of charger options that may or may not be the best for the phone...talk about a waste of time.

" October 25, 2022",Adam B,"Don't believe the hype, it's just ok","Coming from a 4 and a half year old Samsung S9+, I expected to be blown away by half a decade of technological improvements. Sadly, that isn't the case here. It's actually been kind of a step backwards.Battery life is average. I get better battery life than my last phone at the end of its life, but it isn't as good as when I first got my S9+. The adaptive brightness is very bright, the phone has gestures turned on by default that keep it on almost non-stop (these features can be turned off), and the 5G radio probably drains more juice than a 4G radio. If you're a heavy phone user, you'll need a charger. All in all, I expected better battery life.The features of the phone are top notch. The camera is great, vanilla Android with no bloatware is nice, and not having to fight with other voice assistants (i.e. Bixby) is simply amazing. There's no lag when using the phone. Looking forward to near instant Android updates. The E-sim was easy enough to set up through T-Mobile's website without needing a representative. So that was nice as well.What's not so great? The under screen fingerprint scanner is absolute trash. It works maybe 5% of the time. The phone isn't defective, and I don't use a screen protector. It's the quality of my skin, which is probably too dry. I can literally lick my finger and it'll work. I did not have this problem with any Samsung phone, going all the way back to my S7. With that said, it's difficult to transition back to PIN numbers and copying and pasting from a password manager because of the way the fingerprint scanner works. And I'd rather not be licking my finger, especially in public, in this day and age.I haven't really noticed any huge differences in speed for WiFi 6E or 5G. That was an important selling point for me, so I've been disappointed by real world speeds.Transferring phone info (photos, videos, apps, data in general) was a breeze. The USB-C to USB-C cable made it super simple and it took about 20 minutes. You can choose what to transfer.A phone charger isn't included. Your old charger will work, but if you want the fastest charging you'll probably need a new charger. I picked up a Google 30W charger for another $30.I'm hopeful Google steps up and fixes some issues through software, especially the fingerprint scanner, but I don't expect it. This phone could have been a real iPhone competitor, but Google dropped the ball.",4,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone
" November 16, 2022",TJ,"Amazon is excellent, Google customer service not so much.","Update 2/19/23. So last update Amazon graciously gave me a very fair partial refund even though it was outside the 2 month window. (I owned the phone for 4 mos and 2 days) And I have sent the pixel 7 back to them. Google customer service continues to be abysmal. Overall phone was not better than pixel 2 for me, but aside from all my issues still a decent value and I still like Pixel phones better than the competition. Read on if you desire to see my trials and tribulations with the Pixel 7. So I finally got around to working through the warranty process (for cracked rear camera lens) with Google and was put in touch with a local ubreakit/wefixit shop who promptly told me it wasn't covered(incidental damage). I was quoted $249 to repair. I declined and contacted Amazon again who proceeded to offer me a very fair partial refund which I accepted and sent the phone back. I am back to using my pixel 2 which still works better for me, while I regroup and figure out what is next. Thanks Amazon you are absolutely fantastic you didn't have to make this right and you did, so thanks,  and if you make a smartphone I would love to buy it. Google customer service your lucky I still like the pixel because you are absolutely atrocious to work with.Update 1/14/23 on the plus side it appears that the USB c port issues were software related, it stopped having issues after the last update. So that is a win.I contacted Amazon about the broken camera lens it appears this is a common issue on Pixel 7s due to a manufacturing error in producing the glass. Apparently they shatter due to internal stress. Amazon told me that they couldn't help me because it was outside the 2 month return window. But it has a one year warranty by Google. I reached out to Google for the warranty claim and I received an email from a company lawyer saying if I was sueing them about the issue they have received my information and would email me back. I haven't heard anything since. I imagine I will have to contact them again. But only the wide angle camera is affected and I don't use that. So overall I am actually pretty happy with this phone. And now that the USB c port works again it does everything I need. I hear pixel 8 is smaller so will see when that one comes out. Adding a star because everything I care about works now. Google customer service sucks, but still wouldn't pay $1200 for a comparable iphone or Samsung.Update 12/3/22I have started having issues with the USB C port it doesn't grab the cable tightly and causes issues with Android auto and often if I attempt to charge by cable it will appear to be charging and than won't. I have cleaned it out, but no obvious debris. I bought this first day available and received it October 17, so not quite two months. I have worked around this using a wireless charger but still data xfer and android auto are a problem.Additionally I bought and use a Spigen case and screen protector, but I pulled it out of my pocket and found the glass shattered above the camera lens.  I am guessing that I leaned against something with it in my pocket but I didn't drop it or violate it in an obvious manner.  I definitely need a phone that I can carry in my pocket and that is adequately protected with a case and screen protector although a nice phone maybe not durable enough for me. Never had an issue with pixel 2 on the durability front.Fortunately both the camera and phone still work but definitely not tracking for another four year performance.Original review -I have been using this phone for a little over a month. I upgraded from a pixel 2.Pros- Good battery life, updates and is supported for the next 3 years.Cons-Significantly larger than pixel 2, fingerprint scanner is almost unusable.There is a lot of reviews on the cameras and how great they are, I'm sure they are excellent for my uses the pixel 2 was more than adequate and this one is also more than adequate.The fingerprint reader is a problem, the pixel 2 worked almost flawlessly for the 4 years I used it every day. The pixel 7 might work 2 out of 10 times maybe 1 out of ten, it is so inconsistent that I really can't use it for biometric authentication. I have read the fixes and troubleshooting, none of it really works, I'm not going to carry a fingerprint wetter around with me.I think a lot of the things that drove me to upgrade, were do to Google refusing to support the Pixel 2 it received its last update at the end of 2020 and it started a few months ago to experience buggy performance with connectivity and the GPS, with no real fixes due to being two revs behind on Android.For me the fingerprint scanner and size combined with a brand new pixel 2, makes it a better phone than the pixel 7. Unfortunately I can't go back in time and can only hope that in four years pixel 12 is smaller and has a functional fingerprint scanner.The 7 is a good phone and at $500 it is an excellent value. They certainly have upgraded the cameras and the tensor system works well. I certainly am glad I went this route over the other options.I just think there is a point where some of the driving features, cameras, operating systems, weird swipe modes etc are really not noticeably better and drive up cost and size and lead to removal of things I would like such as a stand alone fingerprint scanner and 3.5 mm jack. Hope Google reads this",3,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone
" October 21, 2022",M.,Worth it,"Finally upgraded from a Pixel 3. Under-screen fingerprint reader is working much better than I expected, but still a design decision I disagree with strongly. Fingerprint (I should say thumbprint) unlocks are near instantaneous when they happen, but sometimes it does take a couple of tries. Multi-auth sessions (phone unlock + secure app unlock) do not usually take any longer than a dedicated fingerprint reader -- at least so far.The actual device hardware is okay; the phone feels heavy and solid. The hard edge on the camera bump makes no sense to me, needlessly adding more areas for dust and lint to collect that feels unnatural and awkward in the hand. The official case does not solve this problem. Sound is well balanced for stereo but about what you expect without real front-facing speakers; there appears to be one speaker on the bottom-right edge of the device and another underscreen up top. Audio is too tinny to my taste for music, but I am impressed with that balance of sound from L to R between mismatched speaker types.Software-wise, the Pixel-to-Pixel transfer process was terrible, relative to recent experience with Samsung-to-Samsung. Some apps came through with their settings intact while others needed to be set up again from scratch or synced manually. A few old legacy apps I relied on were suddenly no longer supported despite using the same version of Android. System settings were a mess seconded only by another maze of broken menus for the Google Assistant. Scroll momentum felt actively bad on the device, although it was improved quite a bit by installing a ready software update. I expect this to continue to improve in time, although it again begs the question: Why didn't someone try this before making a bunch of them?For $600 on the 128GB model this thing is a steal though, and I feel confident recommending it easily. I think Samsung's doing a better job of maintaining consistency within their ecosystem, and Motorola is doing a better job at Android than Google, but for the hardware and camera you get here on a flagship device there is very little to complain about so long as you are comfortable waiting for Google to improve device performance and features via software updates.Would I rather see another Google-made device with a flush candy bar design, stereo front-facing speakers, and a dedicated fingerprint reader like my old Pixel 3? Definitely, take my money. But until that one shows up, this one will do just fine.",4,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone
" November 9, 2022",Alex,Pixel 7 good,Hey google... You give a data cable and a usb to C cable connector. Makes no sense. If you have the connector give the customer a regular usb to C cable instead. The connector can be used with that cable plus the cable then can be used to charge the phone many times. Why do I need a data cable that I'll likely use once or never? It seems like a small thing but it puts a burden on customers with no phone charging cable who needed one. Plus I'd rather have an extra usb to C cable than a data transfer cable for how many more uses it has. Lastly are we really at the point that no one thinks to just include a charger with the phone and add $10 onto the retail price. I get it your all cheap asf these days but come on dude you need to give the customer some form of way to charge the phone without piggy backing power from another phone...,4,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone

" October 13, 2022",Patrick M. Ryan,I find this product listing incorrect.,"Why does this listing indicate ""Telephoto Lens""? Only the Pixel 7 Pro model has telephoto, while this regular Pixel 7 only has digital zoom.

" January 14, 2023",Carl,It's fine,"It's a boring old Android phone directly from Google. It will do a great job... for just a few years, which is exactly why I am here. See, my old Pixel phone was just fine but no longer received software updates. All the new Android 13 stuff is was out of reach unless you pay to play. Software wise Android has gotten quite good and worth the upgrade for the OS. I largely use iOS devices because I can keep them pretty much until their end of life, well beyond any Android.As for the Pixel 7, it's snappy, a little large for my liking. Well build, but so much glass I will likely destroy. The front metal lip where it meets the glass is quite uncomfortable - not very ergonomic, digs into the hand, a little scratchy even. The massive camera bump isn't my favorite in-pocket experience either. Kinda hate the industrial design to be honest.

Why am I *required* to have a Google search bar at the bottom of my home screen, and the ""at a glance"" tool at the top? Why can't I organize the app drawer into folders? You can use folders on the home screen, but this is not a substitute because the app drawer stays disorganized and you can't see what has or hasn't been added to a folder yet. These design choices (that could change tomorrow at no cost to Google) are small annoyances, but they are visible almost every time I use the phone.",4,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone

Upgraded from an older Sony phone and holy cow was this a step up. Love that it gets at least 5 years of security updates, wish it was more for sustainability reasons but 5 is better than two.Build quality is premium, the phone is snappy, and I've noticed an immediate improvement in my call quality (both from and to me). The camera is surpurb and allows me to take great photos of my dog without hauling my DSLR around. Does it replace a dedicated full frame or apsc camera? No. Does it take photos almost as good for social media and fits in my pocket? Heck yes it does.

" November 25, 2022",flynnflynn,Good value for money If you can ignore the negatives,"I purchased this phone on Black Friday for 733$ after tax. The Google pixel 7 is a good phone. But the fingerprint sensor is very bad. I am actually surprised with how bad, when i compare my pixel 2, which came out 5 yrs ago. I like the face Reader, but it only works when there is good lighting. The other issue is the battery. The battery life is like my pixel 2...bad. I used the screen time for 2h using Yahoo finance, social media and google news and after 5h was at 30% battery. I then had to switch to battery saver mode to last me the day and this is after charging the phone once more to 100%. Not sure if anyone else has the same issue. The pros are: the phone is fast with no lag compared to my pixel 2 and the price is amazing for a new phone.Updated: battery problem solved on its own after 2 weeks of usage. I now get 1 day of screen time with a full charge. After 2 months, i can comfortably say that this is one of the best phones on the market for the price. Only negative is the fingerprint and face reader, which are not that great",5,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone

I am pleased with this phone, especially the camera features. As far as battery life goes, it is about the same as any phone I've had and it just depends on your brightness, background apps, and what apps you use (disappointed how fast the battery drains when playing games). I like the wireless charging feature but most phone cases block it from working (can't blame Google for that). The phone does get pretty warm when playing games or while charging, but has never overheated.I was really bummed that you only get a charging cord with this phone and no block.

Possibly the issue is with Oct 5th security update as connectivity seemed normal before the update. Could be coincidence. Brought phones into TMobile store. Neither had connectivity.

I usually settle for phones costing about $350 or less.  Sometimes I go too cheap, and, as the saying goes, you get what you paid for.  Considering what goes into a phone these days--and I'm strictly an Android user--I figured a smart, economic buy would be the latest Pixel.  Considering Google is designing the software anyway, they're an entire enterprise based on successful software and AI.  These will be the innovators of cellphone software.Well, this did not disappoint.  It's 5G, with WiFi calling, and the camera is excellent.  If there's one complaint, it's that the fingerprint reader seems to fail a lot, but it's probably because the screen protector on it distorts the imprint.  I checked other settings on it that allots for the screen, but it didn't seem to work for correcting the issue.I'd recommend this phone if you're looking for a phone that has the features of a higher end device, but you don't feel like paying a thousand bucks for it.

" November 7, 2022",Kutsufatmo,A warning to users who sideload apps,"Had my Pixel 7 for about a day before realizing that Google in their infinite wisdom decided to disable ALL 32-bit app support, regardless of whether you try to install it as a sideloaded APK and bypass the Play store. This is in spite of the fact that the new chip still supports 32-bit and Android 13 itself is still fully capable of running them, as Pixel 6 phones have the update and 32-bit apps still run. Google is just being petty and thinks they know better than the end user on how to use their phone. What this means is that many legacy apps that were discontinued on the app store will no longer work, despite in many cases still having legitimate uses for certain circumstances. Considering this, and the fact that specification-wise it is only a marginal upgrade from the Pixel 6, you're better off just keeping your 6 until Google learns some humility or someone finds a workaround for it. I would have just let this slide if it weren't for the fact that one of these apps is crucial for my job and it ended up costing me a $50 restocking fee at Verizon because no one bothered to disclose this and somehow that's my fault.",1,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone

The one issue I have with it the most is the fingerprint reader. I have learned to register my finger from multiple angles multiple times so that it works better. If you register your finger once you will have a lot of problems. I actually have three profiles for one finger. Also, I have noticed that after I wash my hands, the fingerprint reader doesn't pick up my fingerprint until my finger dries out all the way, which is annoying.The camera works well and I like taking photos with it. The phone is snappy and works well with the new version of Android. The screen is nice but has the same refresh rate as my old phone so nothing new there. The haptic feedback in this phone is much better than my Pixel 5. So far the phone is very stable and I am on the beta program so I get updates earlier.

It can be really annoying to not even know when you have missed calls until that caller mentions trying to contact you. Secondly, if you do any mobile gaming this phone has a weird aspect ratio that cuts the screen a bit too much for most games. It's not the worst but can be annoying how much extra screen space could be used.

" October 16, 2022",Great Expectations 2023Great Expectations 2023,"First impressions (and updates, issues) - after 2 months...","I just got the Pixel 7 on Friday the day after the release day. I'm migrating from a Samsung S21 5G so I've always gravitated towards the value, smaller flagship phones. Trade-in amount was great direct and almost covered the full cost of the phone/equal to what I paid for it. It was mainly for the great intro deal that I jumped at upgrading a phone that was only 1.5 years old. Also read about the Samsung batteries expanding...Nondescript package came 1 day after ordering. In box, comes with USB-C cable and a USB to USB-C adaptor, no AC adaptor plug at all. I had thought about getting the lemongrass then the white but ended up getting the boring black on the advice of my daughter but also thought it would stand up to wear and tear the best. Out of the box it's very very glossy. It's OK but it's had fingerprints since you first touch it. One weird thing is the box was scuffed up on the outside and the phone had particles on it like it had been opened but this was straight from the factory.I tried to use an eSIM to activate and save the trip to the store but a las the technology didn't work and phone got stuck in a activation no where land. Luckily on Saturday there was a store open that could help me out b/c the phone support is closed on weekends?! Long story short, store was able to get on the phone with their ""specialists"" and get the phone activated by using a physical SIM.After that, brought the phone home went through the menus and use a USB-C to migrate my apps, data over in no time. Easiest upgrade ever (aside from the activation hiccup which is par for course). Overall first impressions is it's a much nicer phone that my Samsung Galaxy S21. Feels better built with more weight with a cleaner more responsive UI than the Samsung One UI. I looked at online videos to learn how to switch between active apps.  I really never did like or find value in all the Samsung apps, much prefer a pure, clean OS which of course the Pixel is.Power button, volume up/down are flipped between the Samsung and the Pixel but intuitively I much prefer the Pixel with the power on the top. As I said, I mainly got the Pixel b/c of the trade-in deal that essentially made the phone free to upgrade. I saw the launch event and was very excited about the unblur photo option and being a tech person all the AI/ML stuff enabled by the new Tensor G2. So far after 2 days very glad I upgraded.I have to confess I also upgraded b/c I was having issues with cellular connectivity on through my Verizon MVNO carrier and I read online that this could be a Samsung issue. I'm not a gamer and use my phone mainly to text, as a MFA code generator, for vendor apps (restaurants, transit), and web browsing so my demands are not that great. I'll report back after a while with an update on reliability and any issues found.*Update after 1 week*Still like the phone a lot. It seems much more flagship/quality than my Samsung Galaxy S21 5G. Trial by fire, I took it on a trip to Chicago only a few days out of the box. The Pixel way of switching between apps is less intuitive than the Samsung One UI, still haven't quite figured out the exact way to access all apps vs. view all apps active. I noticed it gets hot or I should say very very warm. I can't quite figure out the situations b/c I don't game. Like watching movies on the plane it didn't get warm but in video mode taking videos it seemed to get hot to touch. The software is buggy or apps running on this version of Pixel are buggy - the United app would often get unresponsive and crash. Network availability and speed of data seem to be better than my old Samsung. I've dropped it a few times (didn't have time to get a case yet) and the phone is still perfect/no scratches/damage - ok it's very easy to drop b/c it's so glossy/slippery.  I've had it slide on it's own off of tables, etc. so I'd recommend to get a case to protect and make it less slippery.  Minor gripe is since it's not flat on the back, pocket lint gets all collected up in the lip above the camera all the time.  Still glad I got it.*After several weeksOS is definitely buggy. Read online this is common for Pixel. Lots of weird behavior from not being able to answer call, to apps crashing or not being responsive. It's not quite enough to sour my experience but definitely noticeable. Coolest feature ever is when you call a service the phone will display all the options without you having to wait for IVR to say press 4 to... and you can press right away. Photos seem nicer in quality but focusing seems more mechanical or slower than Samsung. Haven't experienced to the hot phone again. Battery life is not that good as my old phone. Battery drains fast with use and doesn't charge fast. Samsung had faster quick charge. Still glad I upgraded because connectivity seems better and worried that battery on old Samsung will eventually expand. It also just feels like a better more flagship phone than the s21 which was plastic. It's like the difference between my plastic Windows gaming laptop and my old MacBook Pro - cost the same but Mac always seems much better built.***After 2 monthsOK, so it's still quite buggy. Much more buggy than any prior phone that I had including a Pixel 3A XL and Samsung Galaxy S21 5G. It's a bit frustrating b/c it happens on quite a few apps and doesn't manifest the same way, some it makes the app flash like it's crashing, others the touch buttons become unresponsive, etc. I still like the phone but I guess it's sort of the tradeoff of a Google phone you're the guinea pig for the bleeding edge of the releases.  Battery life is not that good and drains fast if you're using something like GPS. Charging also seems to be slow though I might need to get a bigger Amp adapter. I'm going to downgrade the rating one.  I find it fast, like that there isn't bloat ware, like the quality feel and the design. Camera takes excellent pictures, haven't used the AI stuff yet (taking people out) but point and shoot it takes nice pictures.",4,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone

If you already own a Pixel phone then this will not be an issue, as your 12V charger and USB-C cable are compatible with the Pixel 7; however, if you are coming from another type of phone that is not a Pixel then you will have to buy your own 12V charger.  The box comes with a USB-C cable, and USB-C plug for those who prefer to charge their devices with a computer.Besides the lack of a 12V charger, the phone is very responsive and has outstanding software for the price.  Out of the box, I don't think there's a better phone in the same class as this.One glaring issue that I'm trying to solve right now is the fact that the fingerprint reader seems to be having trouble reading my print.  I've done a reset which seems to have worked for now, but it's a noticeable issue - especially coming from a Pixel 4A; that has 0 issues with fingerprint reading.Battery life is good, though I wish it could have been equivalent to the 7 Pro considering the lack of a 12V charger.

" March 7, 2023",Tamara,"The phone itself was not defective, but the service was.","The phone itself worked and had some cool features, but BEWARE! I did a lot of research and weighed the pros and cons of switching from Samsung to a Google phone. The Google 6a still had more issues than I was willing to put up with so I waited for the Pixel 7 to see if those issues would be resolved. To my excitement, they were. I got this phone on Friday afternoon and by Saturday afternoon while out running errands, the phone was constantly dropping cell service. I was in a 5G area, and I've lived here for 4 years, so I know I should have had service. I got home, followed some online instructions to reset the network and hoped it would work. The next day, on Sunday, I went out for the day and again had no service off and on. I have Cricket service, so I went to the Cricket store and spent an hour troubleshooting and replacing the SIM card. I walked out hopeful and halfway home, I dropped service. I contacted Google support on Monday morning and after 2 hours, they told me that dropping service and having WiFi connection issues has been a problem since the phone launched in October of 2022. They assured me that they are trying very hard to have an update that will ""hopefully"" resolve the issue within the month, but they can't guarantee it. They also told me that even if the update works, it's only going out in batches, and it could still take another month before this phone gets the update. I work from my phone quite a bit and travel fairly frequently, so not having reliable service is a make or break for me. My phone is essentially a mobile computer and while there are some cool features, it's not worth months of hassle waiting for an update. I would switch to the Pixel 7Pro, but Google informed me that it's been an issue with that phone, as well. Hopefully in the future, Google will do a better job at making sure the basic features work instead of focusing on whether or not the home screen can rotate. Hope this helps in someone else's decision on whether or not to purchase this phone, as I wish I had known this was an issue to begin with.",3,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone

The screen looks good, everything transferred over easily, and the camera takes great pictures.  Security updates until 2027 means no forced upgrades for a while.  After comparing to the Pro I'm happy taking the standard model.The issue is that I can't count on it to charge with anything I currently have.  It only comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable, no wall plug.  When using the majority of my USB cables and plugs it looks like it is charging, but when checking settings it says ""connected, not charging"".  This hits after assuming the phone has been charging all night.  Since it's a new phone the battery didn't drain too far, but now the paranoia has set in.Chargers for Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, and the giant Anker PowerCore 28600 power bank worked for me. My other portable chargers and adapters are now useless. (Tried the adaptive power settings and the same cables for working/non-working as suggested online, it's the phone)Upgraded from a OnePlus 6T.  Pixel 7 is the same size and I'm happy it doesn't have the delayed notification issue that made me set a daily calendar reminder to check Gmail after a OnePlus OS update.Overall a good phone but I didn't sign in for throwing out all of my chargers, and the paranoia of which will work.",3,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone

Also, the battery life is decent but if you want a phone with really great battery life there are probably better options out there.

" February 13, 2023",Madi,Not at all worth it (5 major complaints),"I've been using this phone for about a month now. This phone feels like worse quality than my 4 year old Pixel. I bought it to upgrade to a newer model that would be in better condition with a better camera. The battery life is fine so far but (1) this did not even come with any useful charging cables. I had to order something entirely new/separate just to charge it. It came with a cable with two USBC ends and no wall block. What current wall block would have a USBC port? Why not include a cable with a USB end? I already felt like this was a red flag. (2) The phone camera really isn't any better than my old pixel which was a hand me down that I acquired in 2019. So I spent over $600 for little to no camera upgrade that didn't even include a means for charging. (3) The biometric unlock NEVER WORKS despite taking over ten finger print samples. It's infuriating. (4) No matter how many times I reset problematic apps like Google Wallet, it just automatically turns back on which frankly sketches me TF out.  There is NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF PERMANENTLY. I sell my own products using a Square reader so anytime my phone gets close to a payment system, it automatically pulls up my Google Wallet WHICH I HAVE TRIED TO TURN OFF/DISABLE MULTIPLE TIMES. I have never once actually wanted/needed to use it yet it's so sensitive that it pops up on my screen almost constantly when I'm out and about. (5) This phone is so big I can't even enter my passcode to unlock (BC the biometric login NEVER WORKS) because my thumbs aren't long enough to reach across the screen. (6) I'm also logged into Spotify and use it all the time, yet when I set my alarm to a spotify station, the alarm always defaults back to the annoying and abrasive alarm that sounds like a nuclear meltdown alarm and reads 'not logged into spotify'. Even though I open the spotify app and it it logged in. I also set my default alarm to a different sound that doesn't give me a heart attack, yet it always automatically defaults back to the alarm I don't want to be using.Don't even get my started on google photos' storage and backing up.Basically the apps are garbage on this phone and it's not even remotely an upgrade in terms of hardware.

So all the app that you usually remove from an android phone are the default apps here. And just like youtube keeps on ""recommending"" upgrading to premium, this phone does the same for storage space on photos and 1 app. It is basically a cheep attempt to get you to subscribe to their services.The phone design is bulky and in a stupid attempt to make is ""Slimmer"" they completely neglected the balance of the phone. The phone is heavier from the camera side and always feels like it is being pulled from the back due to the camera being bigger than the rest of the phone.it overheats really quickly, although I did not use it that much.

" February 8, 2023",Bob,"Poor phone call audio, connectivity","I really, really, really tried to like the Pixel 7. Both my wife and I got Pixel 7s because of Google's update promise, the cameras, the Google apps, etc.  Got off to a rocky start when our phones were stuck on the Nov 2022 update and we were into Feb.The thing that bugged me most about the phone, though, was the call audio.  It's the worst call audio of any cell phone that I have owned. The problem was most noticeable when talking to someone on another Pixel 7 (like my wife has). The audio was distorted, with a sibilant hiss in the high frequencies. The microphone is extremely sensitive--my wife re-gripping the phone, swapping hands, changing her position while sitting down, etc would distort the audio. I was constantly having to ask her to repeat herself.The problem wasn't limited to the Pixel 7s, but also caused issues when talking to people on other cell phones and land-lines.  Multiple people told me (unsolicited) that call audio from me was poor on their end.Google had put out a 'Clear Calling' update in Dec (which our phones hadn't gotten since we were stuck on the Nov updates).  We were hoping that would clear up the audio issues.  We finally got the update in Feb, but 'Clear Calling' didn't fix the issues. I'll probably return the Pixel and try another manufacturer.UPDATE:  I returned the Pixel 7, and got a Samsung S22+, and have had no audio issues at all talking to my wife on her Pixel 7, which she kept. Driving to work, the Pixel would drop from 5G to 4G LTE in one area and the S22+ stays in 5G (at 3-bars out of 5).",3,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone

" October 28, 2022",QponMomma,comparing to a Google 5A,"I'm a mom of many kids, not a techy. My review will not be techy at all, just my opinion and experience as a typical user.Honestly, I miss my 5A. This took about 30 minutes to set up and transfer all my apps/data (which was seamless and awesome) but it was HOT when it was done. The whole phone was hot. It will get overly warm when I use the GPS a lot, too. This worries me long term.The fingerprint scanner is almost worthless. I miss the back scanner, it always recognized my finger unless I'd just gotten out of the shower and had too much moisture on it. This in the glass scanner recognizes my fingerprint 95% of the time the first few hours after setting it and then it completely stops and recognizes it only 5% of the time thereafter. I tried deleting it and resetting it. And I had the same problem. I have a theory... as the day goes on, my fingers dry out or hydrate more depending on my surroundings and fluid intake. Could the glass fingerprint reader be so super sensitive that it cannot accommodate for those fluctuations? It's frustrating, that's for sure.The facial recognition works most of the time, unless I'm laying down or don't have my glasses on. But even when it works, I still have to touch the screen and slide up to unlock it. It's not automatically unlocked just because it sees my face. This is annoying to me.The camera is fun. There's new settings I've been playing with that I need a lot more practice with. I was able to take a neat photo of the night sky with the astrophotography mode. And some of the cinematic photos videos are neat but not perfect - for instance one of my son fishing captured my son and the fish but not the rod so it just looks weird. A lot of this is just on me needing more practice. The options are nice to have!Battery life seems good. It lasts all day and I'm a pretty heavy user between GPS, using data and taking photos. I currently don't have a TV hooked up (we moved and lost the TV power cord...ha). So I've been using my phone to watch videos and the battery life has held up.Overall, I like it. I don't love it. But I also don't like change... so I recognize that some of my issues are me and not the phone. If the fingerprint scanner worked well, and the phone never got warm, I'd be delighted with it! Instead I'm left content with it and happy with some of the new camera features.",4,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone

Fingerprint reader still is a far cry from the 5 goodness, but there is face recognition on the 7 (that is maybe too sensitive). Overall, very good phone for the money.

" October 16, 2022",juicysdad,"Fantastic upgrade from a Pixel 4, a few minor issues","10/20/2022 update was mistaken in stating the support commitment.  OS updates for a minimum of 3 years, security updatea for a minimum of 5 years.Battery life within the first week has been decent.  I was expecting worse based on some comments from friends.I haven't encountered any heat issues after the initial setup.  I have a case on it now which should keep the cameras from getting scratched when the phone is resting on a surface.I have updated my review to five stars after spending almost a week with the phone.Choosing between the 6a and the 7=================================================================================My Pixel 4 was getting to the end of Google's update support cycle, so I had been looking at some of the newer Pixel models, including the 6a.  The 6a is great in every way, but some minor missing features swayed me away from it:  1.  Reduced water protection (IP67 instead of IP68), 2.  Support for AptX HD, 3.  Better Gorilla glass protection (7 is all Victus, 6a is 3), 4.  Wireless charging.  There are other fairly major differences as well (better cameras, better SoC, 4k video recording, 90Hz screen, more RAM).  With all of those differences, it's fair to see where the extra $150 from the 6a to the 7 can be justified.I think Google has made a great decision by including the Tensor SoC in the ""a"" family of their phones.  That in itself will elevate the user experience for the mid-level phones.  Now you don't have to choose between performance AND features.  You just have to see if the features from a non-""a"" model justify the additional cost.  In my situation, having some features I use daily (wireless charging, AptX HD, better environmental protection, upgraded cameras) justified the extra $150 over the Pixel 6a.Upgrading from the Pixel 4 to the 7=================================================================================Google has significantly streamlined the upgrade process with their latest releases (Android and Pixel).  A simple USB-C to USB-C (cable included) connection between the phones transferred all the data.  The Pixel 7 then spent most of the time downloading and installing all the apps from the Pixel 4.  Moving the SIM with the SIM tool (also included) was simple as well.  There's not much else to say about the upgrade, other than it was as seamless as I could imagine.Noticeable differences from the Pixel 4=================================================================================Honestly, the Pixel 7 doesn't feel ""faster"" when just using it for day-to-day tasks (email, text, camera, etc.).  The Pixel 4 also has a 90Hz screen, so no differences in how smooth the interface feels.  Since I skipped the Pixel phones between the 4 and 7, I did not experience the loss of the face ID login method.  I really do like having that, and I'm really happy with the under LCD fingerprint sensor.  It seems to be working fairly well so far.  I have no hands on experience with the issues that were reported with the under LCD fingerprint sensor of the Pixel 6 series.Apps launch quickly, I find myself rarely waiting on the phone.  Whether it's the camera or another app, switching between them is easy, and unlike older or more lower end phones, I don't seem to have to kill other background apps to recover performance.The Negatives=================================================================================The negatives aren't terrible, but if I can usually identify at least three things, I will knock off a star from the overall rating.  The first thing I noticed is that the phone produced a significant amount of heat when it was completing the transfer from the Pixel 4.  I didn't experience this with the Pixel 4, or any of the phones before it.  Second, the camera bump is fairly prominent.  I don't have a case for the phone yet, and I have to be fairly careful about where I place it.  Lastly, the glossy back is prone to lots of fingerprints and scratches, even just after a few hours of usage.  I imagine even with a case on, the back will experience some scratching over time.  Unless Gorilla Glass Victus is going to prevent that!My Prior Phones=================================================================================I have had Google phones since the Nexus 4.  Disclaimer:  I worked in a group in a corporation that designed custom CPUs for almost all the high end Android phones since the early 20-teens.  From there, I had a Nexus 6 (too big, last of the 32-bit CPU giants), Pixel XL (last of the true custom CPUs), and then I switched to some low end Moto phones (X4, and G Power).  I thought the low end phones had caught up on the compute side, but I was sorely wrong.  The difference in user experience between the lower end Moto phones to the Pixels is staggering.  I actually only purchased the Pixel 4 a few months ago to replace the 2021 Moto G Power.  The difference in usability was instantly noticeable.  The Pixel 4 never struggles with anything, including when connected to Android Auto in my car.  The Moto G Power would often get overwhelmed, so I had to kill a bunch of apps before connecting it to my car.I have never owned a phone outside of Moto or Google, simply because I don't want a skinned Android experience.  I like that Moto adopted a fairly transparent approach to any of their customizations.  Other vendors seem to be more heavy handed and inconsistent.Conclusion=================================================================================I think the Pixel 7 is a fantastic high end phone (although the 7 Pro steps it up even more).  The 7 is an attestation to the benefits of advancing vertical integration on both the hardware and software fronts (with Apple representing the ultimate walled garden).  In another move to follow Apple, Google is going to support five years of updates on the latest Pixel phones (versus about 2 1/2 to 3 with prior models).  This is a great step in the right direction to keep devices secure and usable well into their useful life cycle.",5,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone
" November 23, 2022",Gabriel R,"Broke in thirty days, replacement slow to ship","TL;DR broke in thirty days and it is taking 12-13 days to get a replacementMy Pixel 7 was pretty good when I got it (from Google Store, not Amazon). Battery life was just ok and photos weren't as good as my family members' iphones but otherwise a really nice phone. The problem is that thirty days in it spontaneously stopped working. I took it to the recommended walk in shop and they said two hours to fix but then called back (to my daughter's phone) to say it's irreparable, Google will email you about a replacement. 24 hours later Google hadn't emailed so I went on the site and chatted with a support agent with no reading comprehension who told me they could send me a new device in 3-5 days. Not great, but ok. Then I finally got the shipping notification and it said 12-13 days.Bottom line, I can accept a phone that breaks if they replace it in 48 hours but this sucks.",1,B0BCQXXRJJ,Size: 128GB | Color: Obsidian,Google,Smart Phone

" April 1, 2022",Amazon Customer,Great overall phone," Special Edit   Many if not all recent Samsung phones no longer come with the usb wall  charger. You will not get it in the box.Coming from an A7 2017 model, this phone is incrementally great. Its not a huge difference but the main issue today is really OS and security updates end thus forcing a new phone. Because of using Samsung SmartTags, I likely cannot use a custom rom. If it wasn't for that, the A7 2017 really isn't that far from this. That's something I can now test.The A53 has a surprisingly better speaker. Really loud and sounds like it's coming from the front instead of the bottom where it is. Actually, seems they also use the call speaker as well to output sound which is on the top.The camera is a bit better of course. It's good enough. I'm no camera snob or you better be buying the most expensive phones if you ask me. Has macro function. Also does a good job focusing.The fingerprint reader is about the same once enabling it to always show on the always on display (AOD) and I set AOD to always show as well.The screen is good. There's no wild difference other than marketing.Battery seems about the same in limited testing (my A7 still gets about 48 hours with AOD enabled and some use). The battery saving special modes can add up to days of battery life mostly on standby. So in theory up to 7 days. The A7 has this feature and its great for no power emergencies. Looks like a bit differently implemented on the A53 but still have to properly test it. I know for a fact that Android devices can last up to 12 days on standard batteries as I have one that does. A much bigger screen, etc at 7 days standby is wonderful. My numbers for sleep drainage show it might even make it without the battery saver.But, the A53 battery will take some weeks or months to properly see how the battery does. Interesting, point AOD here has no auto off (and on) while down or in a pocket which is crazy. That instantly saves battery and is crazy they no longer have it. Instead they have schedule so you can at least get a partial worse effect of it at night when sleeping or tap to show, etc. The A7 thus gets me only total 3-4% drain at night even with AOD enabled. So far, the A53 with AOD always enabled sees 3% for 7 hours overnight. Looks like 4% per 8 hours. This is for my setup. Your's may differ.Actually,  one of the best improvements appears to be the cellular connection. It appears to be 2-3 bars stronger than the A7. Since the A7 was typically at 1 bar for me, it would often not receive calls, delayed messages, etc. So far,  I'm receiving everything. This was a main issue I always had with the A7. Easily exceeding everything else the phone offers.By the way, I'm using the A7 wall charger here.  It's 15 watts. That's fine. The A53 just charges 10 watts slower than the maximum. I see no need for now to spend more for that. It just charges a bit slower. As I edited in earlier, don't expect Samsung include them now with their phones. The A53 does not come with one for anyone who thinks it does. Neither does their more expensive models this year.So far not seeing any issues. I'm happy with it.  But, there's far too many features anymore. Takes a lot of time. I'd still be almost as happy though with the A7 if it wasn't trashed by the phone manufacturers like they are. But, if you need a phone, this one is a great choice. I highly doubt that will change here. You also get up to 4 years OS upgrades and 5 years security which increases the value of this phone over many manufacturers.Bug: AOD stuck at full brightness in the dark thus consuming more battery. SOLVED: The eye comfort shield (what they call the software blue screen filter for night time that makes the screen yellowish) causes AOD to have problems dimming when both are running.",5,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone
" April 3, 2022",MiamiOne,The Good the Bad and the Well That's Nice-update,"Update- I have now had this phone for over a month.  A little distressed to see it has already dropped $100, but that is my fault for jumping the gun.My previous phones were a Nord 10 and a Moto G 5G phone (which I still have).  Also a Samsung A52s, which I had for just a few days before sending it back to Amazon.Here's the deal.  The Samsung A52s 5g had a Geekbench 5 score of 721, vs. this new Samsung A53.  The qualcomm processor on the A52s 5g is noticeably faster than this Exynos chip and I can tell that as well in operation.  There's always a little pause, before something happens after touch the screen with this A53.Compared to the Nord 10 and Moto G 5g, though, this phone this phone has faster test numbers.Screen Brightness and battery life is what I wanted in my newest phone!  Didn't get it!  The 5000ma battery does not last any longer than that of the Nord 10, the Moto G 5g or the A52s that I had.Size in this case, does not make a difference.  By the end of the day, I'm still down to 20% or less.  My previous Moto G Power 4g phones would run easily three days, with their 5000ma batteries.  What gives?  Screen brightness is still a problem.  In bright outside light, I still can't see the screen on this phone either, without shading it with my hand.Lastly, the lack of a headphone jack, although I knew it upfront, did turn out to be a problem.  I usually carry around some Panasonic earbuds.  When at an airshow recently, I popped them into my ears, to reduce the noise.  Then remembered, that I couldn't connect them to the phone.Now the good things- 1) I did speed test, near a collection of 5g towers.  My previous Moto G 5g and my Nord 10, while running on T-mobiles network, never achieved more than 58 megabits of download speed.  Which means their tuners could only handle the lower and possible the middle 5g spectrum.  fyi-there are basically 3 group of frequencies (think-low, middle, high).This Samsung A53 achieved more than 300 megabits of speed next to the same set of towers.  That's almost 6 times the download speed of my other 5g phones.  Which means it can tune into the higher spectrum frequencies.2) The microSD expansion slot is a little weird.  The sim goes on one side, then you flip it over to insert the microSD card.  But it handles my 400 mb microSD card and transfer rate s to it are quick.3) It seems sturdy, I've dropped it a time on two within the house.  However, I had it encased in a Spigen, my favorite brand, of cellphone case.My basic opinion, is to give it 4 out of 5.  Mainly because of the lukewarm battery life, sluggish initial touch screen response, underperforming exynos processor and screen not being bright enough against the sun.But the speed of the cellular download, the expansion slot, the screen clarity, the toughness of the phone, make me give it 4 out of 5.  It's dropped $100 in less than 45 days.  That's a bummer.",4,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A54,Samsung,Smart Phone
" April 7, 2022",Simply Sue,Great Phone For The Price!,"What I look for in a phone maybe different than others look for, so here is my take.  I look for a phone with a reasonable price (well below $1000), a decent camera (64 MP main rear), great updates (4 years of Android and Security Updates), and easy to use.  This camera fits all of my criteria and it is also 5G.  Like all batteries, it can be quickly drained depending on usage but, with the right configuration (meaning eliminating things you don't use, turning off wi-fi, Bluetooth, and mobile data when not in use, and so on), it is easy to get 1 or two days of usage.  A charger does not come with the phone, but the proper cable with a USB charger works fine.  In order to protect the battery (which like most cannot be easily removed/replaced), the phone stops charging at 85 %.  As long as I can get 2 days of usage without charging, I don't mind.  I do not watch videos on my phone and use wi-fi for my updates.  I am a simple user, mostly talk and text, so this is a great buy for me!",5,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A55,Samsung,Smart Phone

" July 20, 2022",AN,Flagship features at a mid-range/budget price,"Overall, this is a great Samsung phone that offers a smooth user experience.Pros:- It's fast.- The screen resolution and refresh rate are excellent.- Smooth experience streaming videos. Great sound quality.- Fingerprint sensor works very well.- Battery life is great - easily lasts more than a day (I usually charge it every 2-3 days).- Excellent storage capacity.- Takes clear and sharp photos and videos.- Great phone call quality.- Love the fact that it will receive 5 years of security updates, which is very important these days.Cons:- As with ALL Samsung smartphones, there is A LOT of proprietary bloatware (I previously owned a Pixel and iPhone, both of which contained very little bloatware). I was able to uninstall a few bloatware apps and disable others. For the apps I couldn't disable, I denied them the ability to run in the background and restricted battery access, which helps to extend the daily battery life for up to 2-3 days. They can also be hidden from sight.- I found it annoying that Samsung has its own redundant app store to Google Play and has proprietary apps that ask the user to create a Samsung account. Seems unnecessary when the phone runs on Google's Android system.- No travel adapter included. Seller got the description wrong about what's included in the box. - No wireless charging, but not a big deal for me.Overall, this is a great phone for the value despite the bloatware. For users unaccustomed to Samsung, if you spend some time customizing the permissions and notifications for the bloatware apps, you'll likely enjoy using the phone, too.10/11/2022 Update:- Phone continues to work well for my average user needs, e.g, talk, text, web surfing, streaming, reading ebooks/newspapers/magazines, using Google Pay/Maps/Drive/Docs/Sheets/Notes and other productivity apps, taking pictures, etc.- Battery life continues to be excellent, as I've ensured that most apps (other than the communication apps) do not use background data and have restricted battery access. If you don't make those adjustments, they would drain any big battery quickly.- I like the default Device Care app that helps to further optimize the battery life and puts to sleep apps that haven't been used in a while.- Taking screen-prints is not straightforward, as I had to research online on how to do so. There's no app/icon for it. I have to push the Down button and Power button (located on the same side) simultaneously to print the screen. Not the most convenient.- I can't opine on the dual sim or SD memory card features, as I don't use them.",4,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A58,Samsung,Smart Phone
" May 27, 2022",M.C.L.,"GREED RULES: No travel adapter-charger, no 3.5mm audio, no headphones, bloatware, etc","Samsung is getting greedier by the year. The A53 is a midrange phone (for more budget conscious consumers) yet they stopped including a travel adapter/ power charger (Amazon's description falsely claims it includes a travel adapter charger). And your regular USB adapter-chargers from other phones or most previous generations of Samsung phones don't work with the USB cable included with this phone because the cable they included is a USB-C to USB-C cable rather than a USB-C to USB-A cable (so you can't use your older chargers and you can't charge with your computer). A USB-C to regular USB cable would allow it to be compatible with virtually any USB charging device on the market, but Samsung didn't want to make it easy for you and likely wanted to sell the consumers their own travel chargers that only has a USB-C port and not a regular USB or mini-USB port.Furthermore, this phone also doesn't have 3.5mm audio jack and doesn't include wireless headphones. This means my older headphones that don't have bluetooth are useless without buying adapters. This also means you need to go out and buy Samsung's USB-C to 3.5mm adapters before you can hook this up to a 3.5mm audio jack in your speakers, car stereo, etc. And because you're using multiple adapters that increase chances for electrical noise-interference, you likely have to buy a ground loop noise isolator if you want to hook it up to your car stereo without bad static (I read many of those adapters get bad feedback noises without a ground loop noise isolator).So basically, Samsung is forcing us to buy $60+ worth of additional equipment to charge this device and listen to music in your car or with older headphones....for what is supposed to be a budget friendly mid-level consumer device. And to add insult to injury, they package it with the BS that they're removing features and necessary components out of ""environmental concerns."" Yet somehow, the cost savings that would presumably result from cheaping out on these additional parts are not passed onto the consumers and the MSRP of these phones are higher than ever.As for the phone itself, for some reason, the CPU in the A53-5G series is slower than the previous A52s-5G series of phones. Why did they take a step back and use a slower CPU? There is also the typical Samsung bloatware that you have to spend 30 minutes uninstalling or disabling unless you want your phone to stutter and run slower. Samsung is becoming a huge disappointment and is rivaling Apple in its money grubbing GREED.",1,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A59,Samsung,Smart Phone
" February 6, 2023",Ox,A really nice mid-range cell phone.,"This is the first time I purchased a mid-range phone instead of a high-end model and I'm surprised how capable the A53 is.  The screen is excellent, bright and vibrant and the battery life is amazing.  I'm not a power user and I don't game on the phone so it's mostly used for texting, surfing and you know...phone calls.  And it's been a solid phone.  Occasionally, you'll see some lag moving from app to app.  I turned off the screen animations and that stopped most of the lag.  But for only $400?  It's a really nice phone.  I don't think I'll ever buy another high-end phone.  This phone does everything I need it to do.  The photos look good and it's fast enough for me.  And Samsung will support it for years.  Buy it.Now about Amazon's trade-in policy...in a word...it sucks.  I traded an S8 for $25.  The phone was always in a case with a screen protector.  For a 5 year old phone it still worked and the screen was in perfect condition, no scratches and not cracked.  However,  Amazon lowered the trade-in value to $11.  WHAT THE @#$%.  They said it was reduced because the screen was cracked (it wasn't).  So either the inspector is lying, the inspector dropped the phone, or the inspector reviewed the wrong phone.  And there's no recourse.  After two chat sessions and two phone calls, not one person understood the problem.  And they couldn't refer me to whomever reviews the trade-ins.If you're considering trading an item to Amazon, trader beware.  They may short-change you, and if they do, you'll have no avenue to dispute the trade value.",4,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A60,Samsung,Smart Phone

" April 7, 2022",Secret Agent,Almost Perfect Phone,"This is my first Samsung phone since the S4, my last phone being a Pixel 4a.  The reason for moving from the 4a was lack of 5G, which for T-Mobile customers who camp or live in remote locations is very important due to the incredible range of T-Mobile 5G.  Both this phone and the Pixel 4a are running Android 12, but this phone has Samsung's version.  Surprisingly I don't find that as annoying as their S4 version back in the day, and it does have some nice features such as being able to lock the home screen layout to prevent items moving, and the ability to preserve battery life both by turning off fast charging and limit charging to 85%.  The main downside is there are apps I would rather not have, mainly Samsung apps, but that's a minor point given the storage available.  The size of the A53 is larger than the Pixel 4a, which is not something I was looking for or wanted, and what results in my ""almost perfect"" title above.This is a dual sim model or single sim, single memory card model.  That corrects one of the deficiencies that kept me from buying Samsung again years ago--the lack of expanded memory.The fingerprint scanner is under the front glass.  It seems to work well, but I'm still getting the hang of learning where to press--that isn't obvious until you try to press in the wrong location, at which time the display will show you.  Being under glass has the advantage of the FP scanner not getting dirty--a problem I had with the Pixel 4a.  I'm not finding being on the front rather than rear to be a big deal.This is may be my first ever non-Snapdragon Android phone, or at least the first in a long time.  I find it very responsive, but the efficiency is yet to be determined due to a lot of daily use just setting up the phone and signing into apps, etc.  But three days in it appears I'll only need to be charging the phone every 2 or 3 days, depending on whether I have the phone limit charging to 85%.There are a few things missing.  No headphone jack, something I never used once on the Pixel 4a and something missing from a lot of phones.  Also it ships with a USB-C cable but no charging brick--not a big deal, and also something becoming more common.Finally, like the 4a, this A53 is made in Vietnam.  I consider that an advantage over made in China for [pick one of many reasons].  Also, Samsung's security update policy is very good, reportedly going 5 years from the March release, which was the reason I didn't look for other 5G midrange phones more the size of the Pixel 4a.",5,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

Myers,"SAMSUNG Galaxy A53 5G A Series Cell Phone, Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone, 128GB, 6.","I was able to transfer everything from my old Android to the Samsung Galaxy A53 without too much trouble.  I used Smart Switch to move contacts, photos and text messages.  It was slow going but finally put all my APPs and games, etc. onto the new phone.  I put photo IDs with my contacts, added Speed Dial, etc. and wanted to see how that went before I put my SIM card and SD card in the next day. . . . and, about that, this was a new one for me . . . there is only one SIM card slot.  When you take it out, you see a silver metal piece that says SIM and I thought that had to be removed.  Looked up the phone on the computer.  You put the SIM card on one side of that metal piece and the SD card on the other side. . . a little tricky to keep them both in place as you replace it into the slot.  So far, the cellphone is working well except that I have to pound on it to answer a call or turn off an alarm, at times.  The battery seems to go down quickly, but I have many things on the phone.  I charge it every night and have a car charger as well.  It is the first time I ever received a phone without a way to charge it . . it comes with a cable but both ends are small and I thought I would use one of my many plug/chargers.  Wrong, because they have a bigger end - like a USB - that goes into the plug.

" September 3, 2022",Joseph,BAD mid-range phone,"Samsung cut so many corners on this phone and I can't stress how much people should avoid buying it.  For starters, 120hz refresh rate WILL begin to slow your phone down tremulously after about a week or so of using that refresh rate to where it feels like an absolute struggle trying to get back into the settings to put it on 60hz.  I would recommend to NEVER use 120hz.  Another thing that I need to stress is trying to customize the phone with all the Galaxy Store addons, like Good Lock, and all the themes, etc you can add to customize the notifications, lock screen, recent tasks, etc.  Doing this WILL slow your phone and make it almost unresponsive.  This phone just simply cannot compete with other mid-range phones, let alone the flagship high-end phones, and asking to pay over $400 is a JOKE.  In all honesty, this phone shouldn't be priced over $200.  The color balance also does NOT work whatsoever.  You can only choose between Vivid and Natural colors, but the color balance doesn't allow you to change between Cool or Warm temperatures.  Another disappointing part of the phone is the screens brightness.  There is NO difference between 85% or 100% brightness, and with it only being at 800 lumens, which I will say my previous phone being a Moto G Power 2021 that had 800 lumen brightness as well.........was STILL brighter than this A53 phone.  I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung lied about it and it was actually 700 or below, and do NOT expect to see the screen outside in sunlight, it's practically like you're looking at the screen being off.  Oh, and one more thing is the signal quality sucks.  5G, 4G.....doesn't matter which you are connected to.  You'll only have about half bars for signal strength about 90% of the time.  Like i said earlier, Samsung cut SO MANY corners on this phone and asking to pay over $200 is a joke.  You would be better off saving a few extra $100 and getting a better phone than this piece of junk.  I would put some positive comments about this phone, however, the cons/negatives highly outweigh them that it's not even worth it.",1,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone
" August 13, 2022",Che,I thought this was going to be my forever phone,"First off, I work in IT and am comfortable with new technology. I work as a Software Administrator and I train our Users who need help with applications and devices. I have worked with IOS, Android, and Windows. After reading numerous reviews and watching a slew of video unboxings, I purchased a Samsung Galaxy A53 5G. My mistake.Here's my experience with Samsung Customer Service and the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G.Phone looks good - bloatware is not my thing, but I could ignore it - and the phone is fairly user friendly. I have to say that coming from a Moto G7 to the Samsung A53 - shifting user interfaces - felt somewhat cumbersome.Samsung prefers you use their messaging and phone app as well as their keyboard. You are not limited to  Samsung apps, you may download and install Google message, phone, and keyboard if you prefer.The phone came with 6gb of Ram and 128gb storage. I added a SanDisk Extreme SD card (from Amazon: SanDisk 128GB Extreme for Mobile Gaming microSD UHS-I Card - C10, U3, V30, 4K, A2, Micro SD - SDSQXA1-128G-GN6GN) several days after receiving the phone.During the first couple of weeks of ownership, I noted that there was a notification that the phone had restarted, and I needed to use my pin to sign in. Hmmmm…..when I checked Settings > Battery > Care Report it indicated that the phone had NEVER had an auto restart. At first, I sent the phone log via an Error Report in the Samsung Members app. The replies I received from Samsung ranged from - we need more information; please recreate the issue and send us the logs; wait for an update (they didn't indicate if the update was to the UI or the OS).Well, the issue could not be recreated, because I wasn't using the phone when the restart occurred. I don't Game on the phone and rarely leave apps open.After the SD card was installed and was being used to store photos, I started getting a notification that “Can't write to SD card”. I would have to unmount the card and mount the card to get it to work again. And yes - I removed the SD card and made sure it was in its proper position. I sent Error logs to Samsung for this issue as well - again receiving replies that they didn't have enough information - please recreate the error and send another Error log. Because the Error happened at random times I could not recreate the error.So finally I called Customer Support. I spoke to 3 different agents within 1 hour 20 minutes. The solution I was given was to Factory Reset the phone. If the problem continued, I was told I could request a return envelope and send my phone to a Samsung tech. For a minimum of 2 weeks. NO. I cannot be without my only phone for 2 weeks. I did not have an old phone to use (I had sold my Moto G7). When I asked to speak to a supervisor I was told they were gone for the day. When I asked to speak to the supervisor coming on shift I was put on hold, then the line went dead. I did a factory reset on the phone, reinstalled my apps.The issues have not been resolved.I will not buy another Samsung phone.I realize that this may have been a one off - a lemon - but it was not handled as such by Samsung. I thought I could keep the phone and keep signing in when it restarted for no apparent reason, and unmounting and remounting the SD card when I was notified that the card was put in read-only mode. But everytime one of these issues came up, I was reminded that the phone was not working as it should be.Luckily I saw an article in my news feed about a sale at Woot.com (this company was bought by Amazon in 2010). I purchased a new Moto Edge + (2022) for half price (12 Aug 2022).Maybe now I can request a mailer and send the Samsung A53 5G to a Samsung Technician for fixing - then sell it.",1,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

This mid-ranger has many features that match flagship phones. The screen is top-notch, the cameras are excellent, and Samsung's software update policy is the best of any Android phone company. The biggest disappointment is the bloatware that is installed on Samsung phones. The Samsung apps either duplicate Google apps or are useless. I have tried to delete or disable as many as I can, but most are still installed and may be running in the background taking space and possibly reducing battery life. The huge number of Samsung phone models for sale all over the world makes it difficult to issue timely software updates. Android 13 updates have been rolling out for over 2 months, yet my phone has not received it. I should receive a security update every month, but my latest was the December update installed on 12/13. It is now 2/7.Updated on 4/8. I received the Android 13 update together with the January security update. I have not yet received the February or March updates.

I tend to appreciate larger RAM and internal phone memory and this model more than filled those requirements, being more than double what my old phone was.  I'm not really a power user with my smart phones.  For me, they are my personal music player and electronic communications (text and email)  That's mostly it.  Maybe some online shopping and streaming things now and then.  Not much of a mobile gamer either, but I am tempted to see what this phone can do.  Compared to my earlier model I'm enjoying it.  Keeps up with everything I have asked it to do.  Heck, I was almost giddy at how easy it was to just move the sim card from my old model (which was with T-Mobile) and it just recognized this new phone no problem.  And the Smart Switch app worked like a charm again.  This is my 2nd Samsung phone now and I've been quite pleased.  It's the first 5G phone I've had.  The first phone with a fingerprint scanner (which was a little clunky for this newb to figure out, but I got there and it's really been pretty cool! So much easier than the passcode lockscreen and I love how certain apps will use it too)  I haven't played around TOO much with all the camera stuff.  All those lenses and such make it seem like it would go WAY above and beyond anything I'm going to be asking of it.  But maybe now is a good time to actually find out what it can do and play around with it.  I'm sure there is a LOT of untapped potential in this phone I currently have no idea about.

" August 6, 2022",R. A. Bay,Very happy -- Great phone for a non-power user,"I almost didn't buy this phone because of a professional review I read that complained of “extremely sluggish performance.” But then I watched a video review that said it was among the very best of the under-$500 phones and that its plusses far outweighed the compromises that Samsung had made (yes, including performance) to keep the price down.  So based on that – and the realization that I'm not exactly a power user – I decided to gamble that it would meet my needs and that I could live with its performance limitations.  I'm very happy with that decision.I've streamed music and short videos, done regular phone calls and WhatsApp video calls, navigated using the GPS, texted, taken photos etc. and everything I've tried has worked just fine and without the slightest hint of sluggishness.The call quality is excellent – better than my land line.  Video call quality is very good (or would be if my friend could learn to hold his phone steady).  Photo quality is good – it doesn't have a telephoto lens (another one of the aforementioned compromises) but its zoom simulation is much improved over my old Samsung.  Battery life is excellent compared to what I'm used to – I seem to use 15-25% of the battery in a typical day and it takes about a half hour with a non-high-speed charger to recharge that much.  And the folks at the Verizon store were very helpful (even though I'd bought the phone through Amazon) in transferring my phone# and moving all my data.So if you're a power user you'll probably need to spend $800+ for the phone of your dreams, but if you're a regular user like me I'm confident you'd be very happy with an A53 5G.",5,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

The phone also doesn't have a usb A cable so I can't even charge it with my laptop. Basically, I have no way to charge my phone until I buy another charger.Furthermore the Amazon reps refused to help me with this problem and claimed they can't send a replacement order with the correct items even though the Amazon product page literally says you can issue a replacement within 30 days: ""Return policy: Eligible for Return, Refund or Replacement within 30 days of receipt""So shame on Amazon for their bad customer service and misleading information on this product page.The phone itself only has a USB-C port and no other ports, so it's a downgrade from the A52 version that also had an audio port.

It has 5G, but otherwise not impressed with signal or wifi behavior. Bluetooth was buggy from the start, had issues connecting to my Galaxy 4 classic watch, and did not see several bluetooth devices as I tried to set them up. I was also annoyed about the fingerprint sensor, having it on the bottom of the screen is not as convenient as on the back. Camera's seemed nice but not that impressive. And of course, no audio plug, at this point almost want to go with the Motorola Ace 5G.Then the straw that broke the camel's back, bluetooth connection to car audio is defective. No matter what you do, your audio on calls is distorted and sounds like a robot voice. Did a search and this is a known issue affecting this and possibly other new Samsung phones. If you talk while driving, do not get this phone. No solution and Samsung is not even acknowledging it as a issue. So, basically willing to downgrade my phone to get 5G and Android 12, but in the long run, it's not worth it. Gonna stay with my S9+ at least until someone else makes a worthwhile 5G phone that actually works better.",1,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

" September 20, 2022",Em,Great phone but a lot of bloatware and setting up.,"This phone truly is a budget friendly version of a flagship phone! However the amount of bloatware that comes with it is rediculous! Hence the reason for taking off a full point! The way the settings are set up also very quickly drain your battery. If you take the time to set your settings right this phone will boast a 2-day battery life!!! The screen sensitivity is incredible and the fingerprint detection is wonderful!!! The sound is great and clear, it has expandable storage, the cameras take very nice videos and photos. There is no headphone jack though and no wireless charging. But if you're like me and don't use wireless charging and use Bluetooth headphones/earbuds anyway... Then it's not really a issue. Gaming is average. But not bad. Need to compromise somewhere. Yeah know? Call quality is SUPERB!!! I love the screen sensitivity it's really a wonderful midrange phone must have!!! Samsung A53 5g for mid range phones did as good if not better in pretty much everything else including a easy to use interface. Samsung also has a clean and user friendly menu panel and display that that knocks competitors out of the park! I truly love this phone!",4,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

Use my phone to text, chat, check email,  day planner, take/ organize photos, listen to podcast and check out social media.This phone (A53) is replacing a Samsung galaxy s7.  Besides cost basic feature I wanted were removable memory card and good battery life. I would have liked wireless charging but with good  battery life it was easy trade off. As I can easily  go a few days without needing a charge.  I purchased an unlocked phone for 2 reasons,  as less unnecessary apps load and ability to switch carriers without getting new phone.Data transfer process went smoothly using the Samsung Switch app. If you have an SD card suggest installing it at same time. THE TRAY IS DOUBLE SIDED. So you will put sim card on one side, then flip it over and install the sd card. There are markings on the tray. Also there are instruction in the tiny printed quick start guide.For security options I put both a pin number and scanned several finger prints to unlock phone. You can use any one of the options to unlock phone.Most ANNOYING thing is how Samsung tries to load Bixby. As when you hold the power button down to turn off phone -it activates the app. Suggest googling how to disable and then set preferences for side keys controls.Other than that it wasn't as painful as I anticipated migrating my data and learning how to navigate.I've had the phone 2 weeks now and it does what I want and it didn't break the bank.",5,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

Knowing I'm downgrading but can't spend over a grand on a phone that last 3 years (average life of all my Samsung phones).  Everything was fine until i try to use it!  From the beginning it made me reformat my brand new Sandisk SD card which I spent over an hour putting my pix etc. In.  Then of cpurse after formatting i had to redo it all.  Less than 24 hours later phone says error on SD card, must reformat!  I was out of the country so didn't do it.  A few hours later, it says SD card inserted!  I had done nothing to it and it came back.  This occurred the whole week I was on vacation, best timing!  One minute it reads, next minute error!  After I got home, i tested the SD card, no problem!  In the mean time, almost once or twice a day, i would pick up the phone to use and it would not unlock with my fingerprint but if I swipe up it'd make me put in my pin then the phone would say ""phone starting""  and I'd have to wait for it to l9ad before I can make my call!  1st I thought it went into a deep sleep mode bc I hadn't use it for a while but sometimes it hapoened even if I'd used it less tgan 15 minutes prior!  Got a lemon!  Amazon CS got me on conference call to Samsung CS who was a waste of time at the end told me to take it to authorized repair but it's brand new, nor refurbished!  Not acceptable.  Amazon would take it back since it's only been a week but won't give me a replacement for the same price (got it on prime day)!  Very unhappy about this!  Guess I will never buy these kind of things on Amazon again!  Going back to flagship phones and Getting it at T mobil or Costco.  Even though Amazon had no problem taking it back (i think, just sent it off today, no refund yet) but i lost about $30.oo on the screen protector and the case which are not defective but I'd used them!",1,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

My phone was on, streaming music from Amazon music the whole time. My wife called my best friend that I work with to see if he was around me, and when he couldn't reach me he panicked and they started calling all the hospitals in the area to see if I had been in some horrible accident.A few hours later I tried to bring up Google maps and it said no service.

" January 6, 2023",Ryan Rankine,Low End hardware is why it's cheap.,"I've been using a Galaxy S10e for years now. It's actually a 4 year old phone. It's very quick and hasn't let me down, besides the low battery life.  I was dead set on a phone with a microsd card slot and a 3.5mm audio jack, so never upgraded.  Since I found the Aftershox Bluetooth headset, fine without the audio jack, so decided to upgrade.Pros over S10eThe A53 has the microsd slot, but it's a lot bigger than my S10e, and even the S10. What I loved about the A53 was that the battery lasted all day on a single charge! That's amazing! That's about all I liked about it.ConsThe hardware is noticeable slower than my 4 year old phone. Like VERY NOTICEABLE. Apps, internet, messaging, notifications, everything had a slight to moderate lag behind it. Come to find out, the hardware is garbage compared to the S10. 3dmark has a 20+% performance boost with the s10 over the A53.Chrome and Amazon apps ran much faster on the s10 even though it's only 4G, the 5G A53 was slower...In conclusion, if your looking for good cheap battery life, the A54 is it.

Still like my LG g7 phone better, but this is a very good, dependable phone. Always a hassle to change phones. Even one Android to another is a learning curve. At first I didn't like the fingerprint in the front, but it sure is handy in the car when sitting in its holder. I am a bit disappointed in the camera so far, but I will have to fiddle with it more. Otherwise I find it to be a good basic camera. I have had a slew of issues, actually weeks of issues getting it to work with Verizon. They finally got it working on 4g. I was to switch to a plan with 5g, but they tell me it is missing some kind of 'code' and they are having to manually do it which will take an additional 1-2 weeks. Even they say it is no fault of the phone, but something to do with their software. I've had other issues with Verizon in the last 18 months, like they couldn't figure out how to discontinue Disney from my account. Took almost 6 months and I had to call every month for a credit, so I am strongly considering T-Mobile, BUT I will certainly make sure they can actually hook up to this phone BEFORE switching.",4,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

I wanted to check out a phone that would be good for myself and my aging mother and then buy the same, second phone for her. Figuring since she lives cross country if I was familiar with the phone I could help her with it without actually being there.The very first thing I noticed was the talk to text issues which was very glitchy and sluggish. Tried to talk to Samsung about that but I didn't find it very helpful. One of the things I was asking about is how to get the microphone and the predictive text on the same bar but they were unable to help with that. Maybe that can't be fixed on this phone which is pretty poor planning IMO. I don't want to have to keep toggling back between the two, they need to be on the same screen all the time.The facial recognition worked the first few times but after that never worked again. I didn't get in an accident or mauled by a pitbull or change my appearance in any way so I don't know what happened. Fingerprint reader also quickly fizzled out. I didn't use the phone enough to comment on the battery life.

My Blu g91 Max blows this away on everything.Pros: It is a name brand so I can be cool around my friends and... nope that's it.Cons: Slow feedback, slow response, 5G is eh (and not my provider), Samsung for some reason keeps downgrading phones from previous models. My A70 performs better at 3 years old. The 64mb cam? NO zoom? really? 108mb on the Blu 91max and zoom 10x with a SAMSUNG CHIP CAM!!!

" September 24, 2022",Don,Larger than we expected but that's not a bad thing.,"First the size of this phone is significantly larger than my Google Pixel 2 or 4a, but it's far from being the largest phone on the market today.  For use by an elderly parent with diminished eyesight the large screen size is a benefit.  Attached a PopSocket to make it easier to hold and carry.Setup was quite simple, transferring files from a Moto x4 was a bit more difficult and took several attempts, including (not mentioned in instructions) specifically downloading Samsung's data migration app to the Moto, but once that was done everything transferred nicely.Have only had it for about two months and got the first monthly security update for it which is great (when I personally owned a Galaxy S3 circa 2013, updates were very few and very far between).Device is quick and generally works well.  Installed Google's own Phone app instead of Samsung's due to familiarity and known spam call blocking features in Google's Phone app.  The in-screen fingerprint reader is good but in my opinion not great.  My Pixel phones have the rear dedicated fingerprint sensor which works first time every time, while this Samsung Galaxy A53 takes a second or so to recognize and confirm fingerprint, and lets me in about two out of every three tries.  Have it setup with a PIN as well, as a backup just in case.Overall it was a good buy and is a great phone for the price I paid (under $400 US at the time).",5,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

You have to hold the Power button and press the volume down at the same time and sometimes that doesn't shut off the phone but brings up the stupid Bisby or whatever their helper is so that is very frustrating.  The fingerprint reader works well and you can put more than one finger to use. It did take a bit of time for the reader to ""learn"" your fingers.  The camera is ok but not spectacular IMO.  I am a photographer and would have liked a better zoom feature and adjustable light feature like on my LG phone.  The digital zoom is as usual - crappy.

" November 28, 2022",Karl D.,Affordable (at Black Friday prices) Entry level Android phone with 6GB memory,"First impressions: Was looking for a decent and affordable entry level android phone with at least 6GB and this appears to fit the bill.  Cannot comment on reliability as its a new purchase.Android 12 requires at least 4GB of memory to run (phone with no active applications that I've launched appears to use  3.8GB of memory). Hence my 6GB minimum requirement.Not much bloatware apps (FB, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft One Drive, Covid 19 Health alerts). I initially thought I was able to uninstall the bloatware I didn't need, but I still get prompts to use One Drive and there is no way to uninstall or disable Covid 19 Health App (you can disable alerts on your screen).Volume and power buttons are on the right side, not sure I quite like that yet.Was able to be recognized on Verizon and nearly completed the activation step, though I didn't go through with VZ activation as VZ required me to switch up to a higher priced 5G plan (would lose my grandfathered cheaper 4G plan).  Decided to activate on Visible (VZ MVNO) instead.Cannot disable 5G.  This gets to be an issue in areas where 5G connectivity is intermittent and keeps disconnecting.  Ability to disable 5G and only connect to 4GLTE would go a long way for your sanity for apps that need a reliable connection.Would not buy the phone at its regular price.  Took off 2 stars for the forced bloatware that does not really uninstall and the inability to disable 5G.",3,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

" July 7, 2022",Jake J. or Rita J.,Not a good replacement for EOL Pixel 3a XL,"Not pleased. I ended up returning it after less than a week. The last straw was when I realized that the phone did virtually nothing better than my 3a XL. Battery life was the only exception and that's obviously not apples-to-apples.Software was my chief irritation. They made a lot of little tweaks to the Android OS that made it less palatable. Why do they make the app drawer side to side instead of a scrolling list? Why do I have to hold down the icon and drag it to the top? Why does one of my audio apps constantly get closed when I'm listening to it such that I have to unlock the phone in order to pause it?In fairness, the main thing I was worried about (the fingerprint scanner) worked just fine. I had no issues with it at all. It's slightly slower than on my Pixel 3a XL, but not enough to return the phone.The camera also was disappointing. I have no idea how Google does so much better at pictures than Samsung, but it's noticeable. Not that I take a ton of pictures, but still.Anyway, it was disappointing.

So if you just want a phone for basic use, nothing to fault here at all, esp at $350!Note that this works on Verizon.

So I did some hunting to find another phone, reading lots of reviews, etc. Money was a factor, so big part of the reason this model won was the price.  I'm really not happy with all the Samsung bloatware on it -- LG put very little on their phones.And the first LG I bought was in part because of great reviews of the camera. This camera is supposedly actually a bit better, but I'm really unhappy with the quality, especially how poorly it picks up color. Other than cropping I rarely had to edit pics on the LG phones but now I have to do lots of editing to have pictures look anywhere close to the actual colors.I also liked that the LG had several ""pages"" you could swipe to from home page to keep frequently-used apps easily accessible. This only lets you put some on the home page and after that you're stuck going to the whole list of apps to hunt for what you want to open.The LG keyboard was easy to use. This one constantly picks up two keys typed at once (even though I hit one) and then does strange things with it so every typing job is a slow chore.Doesn't have as nice a selection of ring tones. Will only erase an entire array of texts to and from a given number instead of letting you choose which ones to delete as my LG did.It basically works. Makes calls, surfs internet, etc. Not any big complaint, just a lot of little annoyances leave me wishing I'd been able to get another LG...",3,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone

Pack phone up and back out 20 minutes each way to ups store. 2 days later samsung tells me it is out of warranty as their is evidence of water damage.  How does a phone that is ipv6 rated get water damage? Well probably because the seals are defective. So samsumg sells you a phone that is  ipv6 rated but then refuses to cover water damage on a phone less than a year old?!?!I call samsung for an explanation and get a rep who sounds like he is working in a war zone. I asked what is going on and he said he is in phillipines working from home and it is loud in his house and ""maybe I would prefer call back another time""... then he tells me I need to talk to the technician who looked at my phone to know why it was decided that it was water damage but after attempting to transfer me tells me they are not open until weekdays. I asked to speak to a manager and he refused to get a manager and kept arguing with me that water damage is not covered even though the phone is sold as water proof up to 1m for 30minutes.Buy an apple they stand behind their products.This is my second A-series after being a flagship phone person since the release of the OG Moto Droid.

Performance was choppy and downright slow at times. The 5g connectivity was fantastic. Download speeds were awesome so much faster then my home internet. Graphics were good. The display on auto has a max output of 1200 nits, in Bright light, or when out in the sun. It also has a 120hz display, which is really good for this price range. Then there is the call quality. Using the handset to talk with someone is clear and crisp. But connect a Bluetooth headset and you go into robot mode. Which is a well known issue. The camera quality is simply put awesome. I am a huge fan of the macro camera it has. Overall camera quality could be better, but is awesome for this price range.

The only good thing about this phone is the battery life.  I'll tell you why the battery life is good...It has a very aggressive application killer that likes to kill even my foreground apps that I need to stay open for notifications.  This happens even with battery optimization off from their chimera app killer and the setting can not currently be changed.  Somehow their bloatware bypasses their own app killing features as I've never had a problem with preinstalled software notifications not working.  The other issues with this phone is,  it's slow!  It takes a long time to scroll through apps with only two or three open. I know it isn't a flagship phone but my old eighty five dollar motorola phone I upgraded from was quicker,  I just wanted 5G.I'm never going to buy a Samsung phone again until the notification feature gets fixed at the minimum.  And even then, not until they stop tweaking the base android software and settings so much.  You can't uninstall any of the samsung apps like bixy.",1,B09R6FJWWS,Color: Black | Style: A53,Samsung,Smart Phone
" July 22, 2022",Ed M,Very unresponsive and often random behavior,"Overall very disappointed with the phone, especially about the phone's responsiveness. I could press and press and press but it simply wouldn't respond most of the time. My previous phone was a 3 year old LG Q7+ which was not responsive too, but then it was a $150 phone at that time. It was free at T-Mobile. What is Samsung's excuse??? Worse yet, often times the response to a presss is random. I know I pressed the icon because the icon kinda blinked, but the app didn't launch. Instead, sometimes the screen changes, sometimes another app is launched. The whole thing makes no sense at all. I'm an I.T. pro, so I know tech. This phone is just bad!

" December 22, 2022",Rudra,"Excellent tablet for artists, students, and anyone else who needs a tablet!","This tablet has become something I happily use every day. I've been trying to get into digital art, and I've tried both screenless tablets that connect to a computer as well as a cheaper Lenovo tablet with a stylus. Neither of those devices compares to the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite.If you're getting this tablet, you are almost definitely interested in the S-Pen. I'd call it the most important feature of this tablet.The S-Pen is in a class of its own; it feels incredibly natural and smooth to use. I wouldn't call it quite like paper, since there is a very small input lag. However, it is still a joy to use, as that input lag is only noticeable when you're looking for it. I only notice it because I've used more expensive Samsung and Apple tablets before with higher refresh rate displays. If you've never used one of those before, you will absolutely not notice that input lag.I also appreciate the magnetic attachment ability the S-Pen has; hopefully that'll make it harder to lose the pen! The Lenovo tablet I had beforehand did not have this feature, which caused me to almost lose the pen once or twice. Also, this pen does not need to be charged, ever. It is powered simply by hovering it over the screen like a Wacom tablet (and, in fact, it is the exact same technology, presumably licensed from Wacom itself). And if you're wondering, it does have a laminated screen, so there is no gap between where the pen touches and the actual pixels on the display. The iPad (not Air/Pro) does not have this hardware feature, which is very important to how the pen feels to use.** General Performance **This tablet has a Snapdragon 732G (yes, the documentation says 720G but all apps will detect a 732G so that's what I'm going with; it also doesn't make a huge difference), which performs great considering the price. All drawing apps I've used aside from Krita (which is definitely not optimized for Android anyway) perform perfectly fine, even with many layers. OneNote, which I use for note-taking, also works very well. An interesting quirk is that when using Samsung Notes, the S-Pen has close to zero input lag, so there's probably some extra optimization there.I can't really speak for gaming, since that's not what I use this for, but I would not expect it to be great. But for regular use and some light multitasking (the multi-window feature is very useful), it performs incredibly well!** Battery **This unit has a 7040 mAh battery, which I actually thought was small for a tablet, but it's quite good in reality. With my usage, the battery lasts somewhere between 4 to 7 days. This is comprised mainly of youtube, web browsing, drawing, note-taking, etc. It also has a very minimal idle drain, meaning that if you don't use it and leave it in sleep mode, it sips very little power. Most smartphones aren't great at this, but this tablet has no issues conserving power when not in use. In summary, I would say battery life is a non-issue for this device!** Software **This comes with Samsung's OneUI 4.1 and recently got updated to OneUI 5.0. OneUI has a lot of pros and a lot of cons. The pros are mainly that it is full of features; anything you want, OneUI has it hidden away somewhere. I've never felt like I needed a feature that wasn't present here. With that, of course, comes all of the bloatware. There are a lot of apps pre-installed with this, such as Samsung Kids, or Galaxy Store, PENUP, and a few others. It's definitely not as bad as it could be. All of the extra apps are at least Samsung apps, there are no third-party games or anything here, but it's still a little annoying. Some of them can be disabled.Customization is great, it has most of what Android 12/13 has by default with a few extras tossed in by Samsung. Overall, I'm mostly a fan of it, and Samsung has been getting better with their update speed as well.** Final Thoughts/Hardware **I'm very happy with this purchase. Since I got it on sale, it was very good value for the money. A couple notes about the hardware: it's surprisingly thin; comparing it again to my previous Lenovo tablet, this was at least a couple mm thinner. It's also very light for its size. The cameras are nothing worth talking about, they just work and take photos/video. The front camera is OK for video calls, but again, nothing that great. Same story with the speakers, they didn't wow me, but they sound good enough and get loud enough. The Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is overall something I'd recommend to anyone looking for a tablet between $200 and $300. I don't think there's anything better than this in this price range, and it honestly might be able to compete at the $300-$400 level as well. I have essentially no complaints about it and nothing but praise for the S-Pen.",5,B09WZ13CBS,Size: 64GB | Color: Oxford Gray,Samsung,Smart Phone
" October 14, 2022",Schlista,Better value & quality than the A8 tab,"I bought this and the A8 on prime day deals.  S6 Lite was $10 more. and only had 64GB storage compared to the A8's 128 GB.  But storage isn't a big deal for me on a tablet, plus they have SD card slot if needed.Biggest differences.1) S6 lite felt better to hold in one hand2) S6 Lite has much better screen colors.  The A8 was way too blue. Whites looked like very light blue.3) S6 Lite comes with and works with an S-Pen4) Geek benchmark scores.  S6 lite was scored 40-60% better.  But just launching things and testing a couple apps both are fine and you can't notice it unless it's a very cpu or gpu intensive app.5) A8 with its 4 speakers was louder.  But not necessarily clearer sound.For me the clear winner is the S6 Lite.",5,B09WYWQZVJ,Size: 64GB | Color: Angora Blue,Samsung,Smart Phone
" November 9, 2022",DLH,"Not perfect, but the best Android Tablet I've owned since the Nexus 7","I'm a big fan of Android. My last  6 phones have all ben Android phones. With that being said, Android tablets have never caught up to the Apple iPad. I'm not a big fan of iOS, but the iPads are just great at what they do. The last great Android tablet I had was the Nexus 7.  I decided to give the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S6 Lite a shot since it was recently refreshed and was on sale at a great price. I'm glad I did. It's a very good Android tablet. It's not perfect. The performance is mid-range and the Samsung software is a little annoying, but most of it can be disabled or uninstalled.  For the most part though, I'm impressed with it for what I paid. One of the biggest advantages this tablet has over the iPad is that it comes with the S Pen. Other features I like is the Full HD screen, mostly metal construction, 4GB of RAM, and expandable storage. The mid-range Snapdragon processor works well too. If I had one wish, it is that the tablet had a fingerprint sensor instead of facial recognition which doesn't work very well. All in all, this is a great mid-range tablet if you catch it on sale.",5,B09WZ13CBS,Size: 64GB | Color: Oxford Gray,Samsung,Smart Phone
" January 31, 2023",Frank Boston,Great tablet without a HUGE expense,"For $300 plus change, as opposed to the nearly $700 tablet I wanted, this is a perfect solution!  (I thought I wanted the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S8 128GB WiFi , until I found the S6 Lite.  It was MUCH easier to justify this amount.)  The 128GB model has lots of room for games, graphics, etc.  It is fast enough for the games I play, and doesn't have any kind of sudden delay like my old outdated tablet had.  I'm partial to the Samsung Galaxy series, and until I have a REALLY good reason to switch, I'll stick with it.  The screen is sensitive, even with a glass protector on it.  The graphics are clear and vibrant.If I had to complain about anything, I guess it would be the screen's ""adaptive"" brightness control.  Somehow, it never seems to darken enough at night or brighten enough in the daylight.  But... EVERY tablet I've had seems to have this problem.  It's no big deal swiping down to get to the controls.  (Oddly enough, I've never had this problem with the Samsung Galaxy phones.)I'm very happy, and expect this tablet to last me (hopefully) maybe three years before I start feeling the urge for something new.  (That will happen when it starts not holding a charge, or not having enough room.  Neither of which will happen any time soon!)I'm also trying to only charge it when absolutely necessary, rather than every night like I've always done.  (Bad habit!)

" December 12, 2022",Maynard ,SD card issue.,"I just received my S6 lite tablet so I don't have a much of a review yet comparing to the A8.  However for the people that keep saying the SD card slot is defective,  it is not.  The tab at the end of the slot holds on to the SD card.  If you force the card from the top, it will not fit, the SD card slides in sideways and the tab clips on to the SD card.  If you slide it in, the SD card fits perfectly in the opening and it's securely in the slot.  Don't follow the tips of people cutting the tab, your breaking the slot design.  My S6 lite was a returned unit so no manual.  I don't know if there's instructions how to insert the SD card in the manual, I just figured it out on my own.",4,B09WYWQZVJ,Size: 64GB | Color: Angora Blue,Samsung,Smart Phone
" September 12, 2022",Adam,Exactly what I needed,"I needed a tablet that would last a long time and this fit the bill.  I used it on a short trip to Boston to Alaska.  Yes, in my world that is a short trip.It passes the endurance test being used just about every minute I was on the planes and when I got to the hotel it still had over 50% battery remaining.I use this for media streaming including local app playback and wireless connectivity to the plane WiFi network to view movies and entertainment.  It was a complete and total success for me.I routinely travel to Europe, the Middle East, and other far away locations.  I'll no doubt be putting it to the test again.The screen is nice.  The only complaint I have it that it is a little prone to static cling.  Nothing a good glass screen cover can't fix.  The pen is OK, just not sure I'll use it.  The processing power is pretty good, not like a PC when doing small tasks but browsing the internet and editing small videos is surely within capability.  Overall I'll give it an A- becasue the USB2.0 connection is something to be ashamed of when trying to copy movies on and off of it.  Why in 2022 does a tablet not have a USB3.0 connection.  The way around that is to copy and paste files via 802.11ac, which is far faster than USB2.0.",5,B09WYY1MQ4,Size: 128GB | Color: Oxford Gray,Samsung,Smart Phone
" November 28, 2022",RON H.RON H.,Fixed Defective SD CARD Slot.,The media could not be loaded.�I bought the blue Galaxy tab S6 lite 64g recently and returned it because the SD card slot was defective. Then I saw the 128g reduced for black Friday and decided to try it again thinking it wouldn't matter even if this slot is defective. Yes this one was also defective. I called Samsung support but it would have taken 12 days to return and receive back my tablet.Then I realised that the small end of the SD card snapped in but the top part of the card wouldn't snap in.

It honestly caught me off guard in a positive way when I was first testing it. Like it doesn't slide in a slippery sense- it has enough grip to  the screen to feel naturally like it's cooperating with your hand, so it's more like it glides near perfectly with your movements. The video I recorded awhile after I got the tablet specifically for this review to help show how the S Pen is in action. I suppose my only “annoyance” while just a minor inconvenience- is the fact that when holding my S pen I accidentally press the button on the side of the pen which pops up a menu note screen that gets in my way. Also sometimes the tablet will very occasionally go into sleep mode while I'm actively using it.I saved a lot of money purchasing this off of Amazon rather than other places- cuz I just noticed at Walmart it's going for $500 currently so I saved like roughly $200 bucks.FishBee Productions on YouTube was a part of my decision to purchase this renewed model rather than a newer Galaxy tablet.(The Freddy Fazbear plush is supposed to be a size reference)",5,B09WYWQZVJ,Size: 64GB | Color: Angora Blue,Samsung,Smart Phone

" January 5, 2023",EquinoxV,"Inexpensive, decent horsepower, S Pen included, cheaper than iPad!","The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite tablet is a great bang for the buck. It's far more powerful than entry-level tablets like Amazon Fire tablets and even Samsung's Tab A lineup, but the cost is still far less than an iPad. It's maybe not quite as fast as an iPad (there are faster models in the Samsung lineup for direct comparison). However the display looks amazing, and the included S Pen is a great feature. There are some neat drawing features, and if you prefer to write by hand you'll find the experience is satisfying. My favorite S Pen feature though is controlling the camera - you can zoom and take photos using the pen. Great for taking wide-angle shots of a group of people, no selfie stick required. But the two best features cannot be found on any current iPad: first, an aux in jack for real headphones means people who care about sound quality can use real headphones with this tablet! And second, a micro SD card slot means you don't have to overpay for storage, just get a cheap SD Card and you're set.

That one began to run slow and black out, doesnt hold a charge or keep one for very long anymore. The display is beautiful and way bigger than my Tab A. I adore the S Pen. It takes some getting used to in this format for me since it does not automatically pop up for handwriting option. That's user error I'm sure so no issue. The volume is very loud and clear. My favorite part is the dynamic screensaver. I get a new picture every time I open it up and man are they stunning. It's relatively lighter even with the case I bought on. It is Bluetooth keyboard compatible which is a big plus and it holds a charge forever. I can use this table 8-10 days before I have to charge it again. My use consists of online games, word processing, and general web surfing. The camera is great. It rakes clear pictures. I'm glad I finally upgraded. It's a functional and enjoyable device to use.

It's fun to use and makes pointing much more accurate when working with small things.The tweaks here and there to Android make it just a touch smoother and easier to use. One small example is the screen buttons are clustered in the lower right corner making them easier to get compared to being spread either side of center.It handles loads well and doesn't crash.Does not take a SIM card and does not make native phone calls but using a phone or text app such as T-mobile Digits or another the call quality is excellent if you have a decent internet line.The glass is fingerprint resistant.I have found no significant shortcoming.

La bater�a no es de larga duracin ya que paso la mayor�a del d�a viendo series en Netflix y la bater�a se acaba despues de unos 4-5 cap�tulos consecutivos. Sin embargo no siempre hago eso por lo que no es un problema para m�. Es una tablet no muy pesada pero tampoco muy liviana para su tamao sin embargo, por su delgadez recomiendo una carcasa o funda de uso rudo para los nios que no son cuidadosos con las cosas y para los adultos que somos algo torpes. El sonido es genial, mejor que el sonido de mi telefono (OPPO A53).El stylus o pensil es genial tambien, aveces cuando estoy haciendo tareas no me percat que el pensil en mi mano est� haciendo contacto con la pantalla y mientras intento desesperadamente mover o seleccionar algo en la tablet esto no ocurre porque detecta el pensil que est� cerca de la pantalla. No tengo peros con eso ya que el problema soy yo.Sin duda la tablet es perfecta, sin embargo para un uso m�s constante y pesado recomiendo la versin 128gb.",5,B09WZ13CBS,Size: 64GB | Color: Oxford Gray,Samsung,Smart Phone

" September 28, 2022",Justin Khoa Vo,Tablet for everyday using,"I bought it for back to school. I thought I could use this tablet for taking note. But I decide to return after using one day. Reason because it was really slow on performance. Since it only had 4GB of memory, then it worked barely slow compared to other brands such as iPad mini or iPad 9th generation. I tried to open some apps such as netflix or youtube and it took for a while to load or even I need to restart the tablet later. So I think I should pay a little more to get better tablet with great performance and higher memory. If you just watch youtube or use social media, it can work for you but if you plan to take notes or do multiple tabs….I do not highly recommend for you.",2,B09WYWQZVJ,Size: 64GB | Color: Angora Blue,Samsung,Smart Phone

So if you're buying this to replace a tablet you have with your cell phone carrier, do your research before purchasing and wasting time.

Exactly the same as the 2020 version except upgraded processor.The build feels solid in your hands but it can feel heavy after awhile of holding. The device is very easily smudged with fingerprints everywhere. You'll start noticing it when using the display.Also the display has no anti reflection coating, so you're seeing reflection quite often.The displays color accuracy and range is okay, the sharpness is passable but noticeable for small text. I think it's similar to the iPad 9th gen but a notch below though. (Not that the ipad has a great display either).The shape of this display is better for streaming shows than the iPads. But this tablet has poorer viewing angles.Lastly android feels clunky. The auto brightness is a joke on this tablet. It can go from 20% to 70% just because you moved your hands.There's too many quirks for me to rate the tablet highly for my intended purposes.",3,B09WZ13CBS,Size: 64GB | Color: Oxford Gray,Samsung,Smart Phone

Esto es una diferencia BRUTAL en comparacion a su antecesor del 2020 que tenia un Exynos que aunque en la fecha era mas o menos decente en la actualidad se queda muy atras. La tableta es muy buena en general, yo en estos meses que la he tenido he hecho de todo y puedo decir que tanto para estudiar, dibujar y tambien para jugar sencillamente esta excelente.Juegos como Brawl Stars, PUBG Mobile, COD Mobile, League of Legends Wildrift en graficos Altos se pueden jugar sin mayor problema a 60 fps. (Habra algunos mas exigentes que habra que bajarlo a medio pero igual ira bien a 60 fps). Hasta ahora no he tenido ningun problema con ningun juego.La duracion de la bateria es muy buena, hay veces que despues de jugar por varias horas aun me queda el 60% de la bateria y suelo cargarla cada 2 dias. La pantalla es buena, pese a no ser AMOLED o Super AMOLED se ve muy bien, el sonido de las bocinas por AKG esta bastante envolvente y aunque hecho en falta para ciertos juegos que tenga vibracion, es entendible que por el precio hayan tenido que quitar esa caracteristica.Totalmente recomendada la tableta.",4,B09WZ13CBS,Size: 64GB | Color: Oxford Gray,Samsung,Smart Phone

" October 30, 2022",Umberto GUmberto G, Ottimo budget phone senza pretese ," Mi porto avanti, NE VALE la pena. Ottenere un telefono cellulare con AMOLED, 90Hz, 128gb, Stereo e con un caricabatterie da 33w per 1200-1300  qualcosa di incredibile. Ma ha i suoi difetti, e penso anche difetti decisivi al momento dell'acquisto, a seconda di ci� che vuoi.��PRO:prestazioni, poichy contiene lo snap 680 che  octa-core in esecuzione a un clock massimo di 2,40 GHz. � un processore intermedio realizzato per l'uso quotidiano senza arresti anomali, per gli utenti pi� comuni. Puoi giocare a giochi medi fluidi con buone prestazioni, ovviamente a seconda del gioco pu� funzionare al massimo. Processore ok, con un buon consumo energetico, niente di cui lamentarsi. Il cellulare ha 4 GB di RAM, ma utilizza una tecnica di memoria virtuale, qualcosa che  diventato popolare negli smartphone poichy la ROM ha una velocit� molto elevata. La memoria totale sul cellulare  di 6 GB, ricordando 4 GB fisici e 2 GB virtuali. Ci� aiuta il multitasking del telefono cellulare, rendendo pi� app aperte in background senza influire sulle prestazioni e sull'usabilit� del telefono.La batteria  ottima, insieme allo schermo AMOLED l'autonomia  elevata. � grande, quindi  necessario un caricabatterie pi� potente per caricarlo pi� velocemente e XIAOMI invia un caricabatterie incredibile nella confezione. Ricarica il cellulare dal 20% al 100% in 40 minuti. in 10 o 15 minuti si carica fino al 50%!! � molto utile quando hai la batteria scarica e hai bisogno di una ricarica rapida all'ora di pranzo per poter finire la giornata. � un esempio che dovrebbero seguire altre marche, invece di togliere il caricabatteria, metterne uno che corrisponda alle dimensioni della batteria, dato che i caricatori standard da 10w a 15w impiegano quasi 2 ore per caricare 5000mah di batteria, assurdo. Oh, e consiglio vivamente di utilizzare la modalit� notturna sempre attiva e di utilizzare uno sfondo nero, aiuta a risparmiare ancora pi� batteria. Lo schermo AMOLED ha questo differenziale perchy non ha una retroilluminazione, ogni pixel  un LED indipendente, quindi invece di avere un filtro che oscura alcuni punti dello schermo per avere il colore nero, l'AMOLED spegne letteralmente i pixel di quella zona dello schermo, portando un nero reale e incredibile, risparmiando energia, poichy quei LED sono spenti. Puoi vederlo meglio prendendo un telefono cellulare con uno schermo LCD e uno con AMOLED e confrontando il nero dei due in una stanza totalmente buia.Gli altoparlanti stereo sono un elemento di differenziazione. Non conosco nessun altro telefono cellulare nella categoria che offra questa funzione (che dovrebbe gi� essere comune, ma...) e offre un suono profondo, ma soffre ancora del problema di essere ancora un altoparlante per cellulare,  un suono OK. Ha un suono HI-RES, per gli audiofili avr� una qualit� da studio quando indosseranno le cuffie e ascolteranno file audio non compressi.MIUI secondo me  la migliore personalizzazione Android in assoluto sul mercato. La quantit� di funzionalit� che ha, la quantit� di personalizzazione che consente  qualcosa di incredibile. Per non parlare del fatto che aiuta con la durata della batteria, tra le altre cose. Buona ottimizzazione, senza contare che l'interfaccia  bellissima, animazioni fluide e appaganti. Gli effetti sonori sono molto buoni, dal suono di notifica al suono di caricamento.Lo schermo AMOLED  di buona qualit�,  lo stesso schermo dell'A32 che colpisce l'occhio. 90hz rende la navigazione cos� fluida che quando prendi in mano un cellulare con 60hz, sembra che sia lento e bloccato , molto bello, ma ovviamente ha un costo, la batteria tende ad andare via pi� velocemente a causa del numero di fotogrammi in pi� rispetto a quelli resi dalla GPU. Ma  possibile lasciare lo schermo a 60Hz per risparmiare energia.CONTRO:Le telecamere sono un punto debole, addirittura deludente. La fotocamera principale ha tutto per essere buona, ma manca di software. XIAOMI non  in grado di ottimizzare bene l'immagine della fotocamera, il sensore da 50 mp  molto buono, ma su questo telefono sembra minuscolo, manca di nitidezza e c' molto rumore quando la luce diminuisce leggermente. Che disastro l'ottimizzazione, e peggiora ancora quando invii agli altri le foto. La fotocamera macro  terribile, lo zoom  OK al limite del terribile e la fotocamera ultrawide funziona solo in luoghi con molta luce. La fortuna  che usando GCAM le foto su questo cellulare sono INCREDIBILI,  come passare dall'acqua al vino, se compri questo cellulare cerca questa app su internet,  praticamente obbligatorio averla installata su quel cellulare Telefono.Anche la registrazione video  pessima e la cosa peggiore  che non c' modo di salvarla a questo proposito, poichy non esiste un'applicazione che fa miracoli e no, GCAM non migliora la registrazione video. Questo cellulare non ha 4k30p  almeno strano, dato che lo snap 636 c' stato il supporto per 4k30p. Xiaomi sceglie di no deve essere una strategia per vendere cellulari dalle linee pi� costose, deludente.La mancanza dell'NFC mi infastidisce molto, non capisco perchy il brand non metta l'NFC su questo modello. � una tecnologia relativamente vecchia, il cellulare del 2014 ce l'aveva gi�, perchy non ne hanno uno sul 2022? Non ha senso. Un altro punto molto forte contro di lui.��️ voto 8/10 ��️Se hai trovato utile la recensione, fammelo sapere!",4,B09QSCYRYH,Color: Graphite Gray,Redmi,Smart Phone

"December 3, 2022",VRB,Ist das das neue 3310 oder was?!?!,"Nach drei Jahren der Nutzung eines Handys aus dem Hause Umidigi, versagte der Akku leider immer after. Musste bei fast keiner Nutzung des alten Handys den Akku zweimal tglich laden. Aber das war auch ein Handy fr 100 Euro (Umidigie) und es hat fr drei Jahre seinen Zweck erfllt.Nun zum Xiaomi Redmi Note 11:Das Gewicht ist Wahnsinn! Liegt sehr leicht in der Hand und wiegt weniger als ein Leberksweck! Schmeckt zwar nicht so gut, sieht aber genauso schick aus. ;-)Das Einrichten ging fix von der Hand, die Internetverbindung luft im Vergleich zum vorherigen Handy um Lngen schneller und es fhlt sich geschmeidiger an. Nicht so geschmeidig wie ein LKW (Leberksweck), aber geschmeidig.Der Akku ist Hammer! Habe das Handy vollgeladen, nix gemacht und nach vier Stunden hatte ich nur 1% weniger. Vom vorherigen Handy, war ich anderes gewohnt. Selbst als ich mal drei volle Stunden Hardcore-Sudoku gespielt habe, hat der Akku nur 11% an Energie verloren. Beim alten Handy konnte ich nicht mal drei Stunden am Stck Sudoku spielen ohne nachzuladen. Das Aufladen geht fix, nach bereits 30 Minuten habe ich bei meinem Gert schon 60% geladen.Das Handy habe ich seit etwas ber einer Woche und musste es bisher nur zweimal laden - htte ich nicht diverse Schmerztests gemacht, wie z.B. den Sudokumarathon oder andere Anwendungen ausprobiert, wre ich mit einmal Laden ber diese Zeit gekommen. Allerdings bin ich kein Nutzer, der sein Handy permanent in der Hand hat. Ab und an mal nachschauen, ob jemand anrief, einmal abends zwei Runden Sudoku, drei vier Nachrichten am Tag schreiben und das wars. Fr mehr nutze ich das in der Regel nicht.Die Menfhrung luft schnell von der Hand, vieles ist intuitiv und wenn manin der Vergangenheit bereits ein Samsunghandy hatte, findet man sich sofort zurecht. Jedenfalls sind einige Punkte im Systemmen etwas logischer als beim vorherigen Umidigi.Ein kleines Manko ist, dass man beim Einrichten des Hintergrundbildes dieses nicht vergra�ern oder anpassen kann. Also man sollte eine *.jpeg Datei schon im direkten Format fr das Handy haben, da es sonst abgeschnitten angezeigt wird.Ein weiteres kleines Manko ist, dass die Kamera bei leichter Dunkelheit sehr stark an Leistung verliert und Aufnahmen sehr karnig anzeigt und die Bilder auch pixeliger werden. Sobald man aber ausreichend Licht hat, ndert sich die Auflasung gefhlt von CGA auf SVGA (die �lteren unter den Lesern kennen diesen Sprung sicherlich noch, dazwischen war ja noch VGA und EGA - oder war nun EGA schlechter als CGA? Schon so lange her... ich werd alt). Fr einfache Alltagsbilder reicht es aber aus, wenn man jetzt High-Endbilder machte, legt man sich eh ne Spiegelreflex oder ein Handy fr 2000 Euro zu. Aber wer kauft schon ein Handy, fr das man mehr als 1.000 Euro hinlegt? Mal ehrlich, dafr kannte man sich 500 Leberksweck kaufen - dazu mit dicker Scheibe. Und wenn man immer beim gleichen Metzger seinen LWK holt, dann bekommt bei einem guten Metzger irgendwann auch mal so ne dickere Scheibe und bezahlt fr eine dnnere - immerhin will der Metzger seine Stammkundschaft ja auch halten. ;-)Fazit: Ein sehr gutes Mittelklassehandy, das sich nur aufgrund der Kamera hinter einem High-Classhandy zurckstellen msste. Aber fr einen preis von 180 bis 190 Euro defintiv kein Fehlkauf!",5,B09QSCYRYH,Color: Graphite Gray,Redmi,Smart Phone

" April 4, 2022",Achadinhos da Web,"Sem d�vida, o melhor aparelho custo-benef�cio do mercado","O Redmi 11 y um celular bonito, arrojado, que vem com uma capinha transparente ""de brinde"" e seu preo y timo, muito mais barato que outros celulares de n�vel intermedi�rio. Em outras palavras, y um telefone que atende a imensa maioria dos usu�rios sem problemas, no gera dor de cabea por suas limita�es, e tem preo de um celular pior - em comparao, modelos da Samsung do mesmo preo, por exemplo, so infinitamente mais limitados.Destaques positivos: - Facilidade de adaptao: mesmo para usu�rios de outros aparelhos que so diferentes da MiUI, no y dif�cil se adaptar: y o mesmo estilo, um menu e �rea de trabalho rol�vel. - Camera: simplesmente espetacular, tanto a frontal como, especialmente, a traseira. - Espessura: fino, leve, elegante. - Velocidade: apesar de usar um processador mais antigo se comparado com outros modelos intermedi�rios, ele ainda y muito superior a smartphones na mesma faixa de preo (considerados ""de entrada""). A memria funciona bem tambym. - Armazenamento: 128gb y bastante coisa. - Carregamento e bateria: a bateria em uso moderado/baixo chegou a durar 60h. O carregamento completo se d� entre 48 e 63 minutos. - Entrega e embalagem: chegou em 48h aps a compra aqui em Curitiba, muito bem embalado.Destaques negativos: - Quantidade alta de bloatwares: sabe aqueles programas in�teis, jogos ruins, cpias baratas de aplicativos famosos? Tem um monte. Inclusive tem um ""simulador"" chines de Instagram (onde celebridades como Aaron Paul tem... 20 likes) e um de YouTube, que y igualzinho ao original inclusive, mas bugado. Incomoda. - Falta de fone de ouvido: no chega a ser um detalhe grave, mas no vem fone de ouvido junto ao telefone (corretamente indicado no an�ncio). - Som do celular ruim: por causa do preo, imagino, o som default do celular y bastante limitado. No espere um surround 7.1. Tambym no y um defeito grave. - Tela levemente abaixo do esperado: no espere a tela do LG G7 ThinQ, por exemplo - a do Redmi 11 entrega menos. Se voce no for um maluco por tecnologia de alt�ssima qualidade, no vai nem notar esse detalhe.Coment�rios gerais: o telefone esquenta levemente ao usar aplica�es como Netflix, que exigem um pouco mais do processador. Isso y normal. Por conta de sua bateria de 5000mAh, o carregador y gigantesco - se est� acostumado com carregadores de iPhone, Samsung ou LG, vai tomar um susto com o bloco de tijolo que y a tomadinha.Recomendo muito, acredito que essa seja a melhor compra do ano em matyria de smartphone.

Il modulo delle fotocamere  di forma rettangolare leggermente sporgente, piacevole alla vista e funzionale, dato che il telefono traballa pochissimo rispetto ad altri device quando lo si utilizza su una superficie piana. Parliamo in generale di uno smartphone ben costruito sia alla vista che al tatto durante l'utilizzo quotidiano.PURTROPPO MANCA l' NFCDISPLAYIl display  certamente un punto di forza per il prezzo a cui viene venduto questo Redmi Note 11. Lo smartphone monta un'unit� AMOLED da 6,43 pollici con risoluzione FHD+ (2400x1080 px) e un refresh rate che passa da 60Hz dello scorso anno a 90Hz. Questo pannello ha soddisfatto le aspettative: bello, luminoso e con colori ben bilanciati.Anche sotto la luce del sole non ci sono stati grandi problemi cos� anche nelle attivit� quotidiane come la visione di contenuti e la navigazione internet. Il display rimane fluido e la tecnologia AMOLED insieme ai 90Hz sono tutt'altra cosa, e si sente.Nelle impostazioni  settare la modalit� chiara o la modalit� scura, regolare il livello di luminosit� e attivare la modalit� lettura. L'utente pu� inoltre scegliere le impostazioni dei colori e della loro temperatura in tre diverse combinazioni:Vivido: regola i colori in base al contenuto visualizzato.Intenso: migliora sempre i colori.Standard: il contrasto rimarr� costante.HARDWARE E SOFTWARESotto la scocca troviamo il SoC Snapdragon 680 di fascia media (octa-core Max 2.40 GHz) targato Qualcomm insieme a 4/6 GB di RAM LPDDR4X e 64/128 GB di memoria di archiviazione interna UFS2.2, espandibile tramite microSD. Lo smartphone rimane fluido e affidabile nell'uso quotidiano e non ha presentato nessun tipo di surriscaldamento o bug evidenti. Per un telefono di un target medio-basso direi che la prova nell'utilizzo quotidiano  stata superata nonostante non parliamo di un fulmine di guerra.Conclusioni:Per il prezzo che ha, il Redmi Note 11 vale sicuramente la spesa. Il design  moderno e accattivante (poi i gusti sotto questo punto di vista non si discutono) e laffidabilit�  eccellente. Anche la batteria  difficile da esaurire, ha una scarica costante e questo  un parametro non scontato per tutti i prodotti.Ovviamente un terminale del genere non pu� eccellere in tutto e il comparto fotografico  quello che pi� si sacrifica sullaltare delle prestazioni.",4,B09QSCYRYH,Color: Graphite Gray,Redmi,Smart Phone

A sa�de da bateria parece melhorar com o tempo e o celular quase no ""engasga"" (tive problema somente uma vez, mas coisa b�sica).A tela de 90 Hz y excelente e as cores muito bonitas.

And I didn't like ANY of them.They had better cameras for sure. Especially the iPhone was my favorite, but I hated using most of them. The s22 and pixel 7 pro were awful to hold, it felt like I held a brick all day. I use nova launcher and pie control for more efficient navigation and the pixel had issues that made it difficult to use. Oh also, the fingerprint reader was so bad and unreliable. Sony Xperia was a cool experience, but overall I didn't like it, iPhone I kept and use but just as a ""pro camera"" and s22 I returned in a heartbeat.Now, the oneplus I can't stop holding and using. Even before I transferred everything over and had the Sim card in, I used it just to open it and see the beautiful screen and the fluidity of the OS. The camera is OK. I'm a professional photographer so can be picky with pics. The iPhone 14 has a phenomenal camera, oneplus 11 has a camera that can take some great shots, just not all the time. There's been some I've been surprised and impressed and others that were just mediocre. I almost got the 10 pro last year and I'm so glad I waited, none of them Felt right until this one. I love this phone. Beautiful screen, super fast, decent camera, OH RIGHT the charging is also insanely fast! Another great thing. I want to add, there has been some pictures that look REALLY good.

Verizon is pushing this hard and it's absurdly fast. Also absurdly bad at penetrating buildings so I don't ever get it on the 14Pro unless I'm bathing in radiation under a tower. But come on, you put the 8gen2 but not mmWave? I'm still getting 350Mbps down on UWB but I don't know how future-proof it is.ColorOS is kinda cringe. Have to relearn the gestures since they aren't 1:1 to Sammy. I just don't get the need to reinvent the wheel with OS skins.

" February 22, 2023",Apep,Flagship device without the flagship price,"Overall I'm loving the OnePlus 11 so far! It really feels like a flagship device, but without the ludicrous flagship price tag. It's not a perfect phone, but delivers on the aspects that matter most to me: Performance, screen quality, and battery life + charging speed. The phone doesn't skip a beat with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, and up to a whopping 16GB RAM. Gorgeous screen with 1440p resolution and buttery 120Hz that dynamically scales down to save battery. Speaking of which, the battery experience is wonderful. I'm seeing 1.5-2 days of regular use before needing to charge back up, which takes less than 30 mins!The phone does have some shortcomings however: No wireless charging, IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0, decent cameras that are overshadowed by the competition, and finally a very different UI experience compared to OxygenOS of the past. These are all sacrifices that I'm willing to make given the price point of the phone.Conclusion: It's a well rounded flagship level phone that makes smart compromises in order to justify a more reasonable price. For the money it's hard to find a better value in terms of sheer hardware specs than the OnePlus 11.

However, you are not buying this phone for a camera. It has flagship specs and performance at the cost of an almost mid range device. I do run into some stutters and crashes here and there, but idk if that is carrier related. That comes to my only problem with the phone. Even though the phone is unlocked, my carrier technically doesn't support it but allows it on the network. So depending whether or not this phone gets kicked off the network, it will be a winner. I did use this device on Spectrum Mobile a Verizon Premium Carrier.Edit in March 6th: ended up returning the phone. This phone is amazing and everything on paper is great about this device.

Display is amazing when watch video, I like the dark mode. 5000mAh battery is big enough for support my whole day usage, and 80W is really a PLUS in experience, I am not a big fan for wireless charging, it's slow and make the device hot, and they have charger in box, I no need to pay extra $$ for the fast charging.

" February 21, 2023",Michael H.,"Good so far, buggy interface... Time will tell","First impression is how beautiful the phone is. This was great because I'm not usually the kind of person who's big into the aesthetics. The only knock to that is the cameras take up such a big part of the phone and are pretty exposed. Kinda looks funky to me, but that's kinda how most phones are going. Because they are so exposed, they will definitely need extra protection there, which is difficult right now because the phone is so new and case choices are extremely limited or for preorder. This is also true at the moment for screen protectors. The weight of the phone is very pleasing as well, not too heavy but feels higher quality.The phone is obviously a beast hardware-wise and the cameras are great for a general user, but are absolutely not top of the line (but close). You can also set upto an additional 12gb of unused space for additional virtual RAM if you want even more speed.Another important thing is the phone is super slippery and hard to hold safely, especially with one hand. So again a good case will be definitely required unless you like smacking yourself in the face at night with it while lying down.Also keep in mind, no wireless charging, which isn't important for me, but if it is for you then keep that in mind. The battery otherwise it's nuts and barely moving. It charged from 20% to full before I even finished moving over my stuff from my old phone (one plus 7 lol), which btw was seamless and took about 20 minutes for ~30gb of data via the old cable.The main reason for losing two stars is that the One Plus launcher keeps freezing and locking up even after fully updating the phone and multiple restarts. Maybe I don't know the technology well, but I have to use the default system launcher and even then it's extremely buggy. The One Plus launcher still trys to turn itself on, so even though I have the other launcher set to default it breaks and freezes the whole phone every few minutes.All in all the phone is obviously still new, so we'll see how it develops. But for what you pay you get a killer phone able to compete with the big guys on *most* fronts and still save a couple hundred bucks.Assuming the UI bugs get fixed soon, I'd def give it 4.5-5 stars initially pending more usage.Edit 3/17: ended up returning it and removing a star. Not sure id recommend it anymore. Constantly buggy and getting worse. My battery immediately started draining crazy fast and would barely last one day. My calls started bugging out too and I had to reset my phone way too often just to make and take calls. Again, I want to give it more stars, I probably shouldn't even give it 2 stars but here we are. If you are in a slightly more remote area then I'd definitely stay away from this one. My old OnePlus 7 pro has better reception than this thing...",2,B0BNWPSCGB,Color: Titan Black | Size: 16/256GB | Style: Phone,One Plus,Smart Phone
" March 3, 2023",Joaquin,Flagship performance without the flagship price,"This is my first OnePlus phone, and dare I say this the best experience I've had with a cellphone. It's not a perfect phone, but it specs deliver in the areas that matter: Excellent battery (I get 1.5 days of use before I need to charge it again) plus the charging speed is amazing, great screen quality and the performace of the processor is great. This phone with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, 16GB RAM simply rocks. Great screen resolution and smooth 120Hz that can dynamically scale down. The cameras are ok, a lot better than the ones my other phones had. Oxygen OS is ok as well, somewhat different from other experiences I've had but it's nice.The phone has some cons that to me are that important: No wireless charging (not really necessary with supervooc charging), IP64 instead of IP68, USB 2.0. But given the price point of this phone, this cons can be overlooked.Conclusion: It's a must get.

One feature that I will miss or havent found yet, is to automatically change my phone to ring/vibrate when I'm using a certain device or on a certain Wifi. It's a feature in Pixel 3 and have not found in OnePlus.Also looking for a case that feels like the back of this phone. The back feels so nice that I want that as a case.

" March 28, 2023",JakeSwagger,Best Decision ever,"I've been utilizing the OnePlus 11 with 16GB of RAM, and I have never encountered a phone that can switch between different applications so fast without having to reload them. Additionally, the battery life is the best I've ever encountered, and as a bonus, the phone can be fully charged in 20 minutes or less. Because of the battery life and the extremely fast charging speed, I do not believe I will ever switch to any other phone brand. The facial recognition works perfectly, even in low lighting conditions, based on my experience. You get an excellent value for your money with this phone, and I recommend it to anyone who is considering it but undecided.

" March 3, 2023",VJ,Fast but not smooth! No Dolby Atmos over AA,"Scrolling:Some apps like YouTube, Google pay, Prime Video etc.. are locked at max 60Hz refresh rate. In other apps where it actually supports 120hz refresh rate, the throttling is very agressive. This leads to a bad scrolling experience especially when compared to similar priced phones from Samsung. Having different scroll speed on different apps is very annoying and it only gets worse with time.Audio:Dolby Atmos only works with Bluetooth. No support on phone speaker and the deal breaker for me - no support on Android auto. So of you care about music quality while driving, look elsewhere.Haptics:Haptics mechanism itself is good overall. For some reason no way to enable haptics for home gesture. It works for back and recent gesture. This is very annoying.Charging:Very fast. Full charge under 30 mins. But you need to carry a OnePlus charger everywhere you go. Phone battery is good, so you can live with it.So the overall theme is that they are trying to make a fast phone, but the experience is NOT smooth. Come on OnePlus, you used to be better than Samsung! People are willing to look beyond the camera experience and still opt OnePlus for the fast and smooth experience, but unfortunately that's not the case anymore!",3,B0BNWPSCGB,Color: Titan Black | Size: 16/256GB | Style: Phone,One Plus,Smart Phone

Why have a flagship phone with  3.5 hour battery life?!The camera works great except about 5% of the time as documented in many reviews.If OnePlus had put a 5x telephoto instead of the ""puny"" 2x it would have been a perfect phone.Who cares about wireless charging (it doesn't have it) when it fast charges at 80 watts and has a great more than a day battery life?Oh, the other thing that would make this a perfect phone is a brighter screen for viewing outside.  I can see the screen but not as clearly as with my 1750 nits Samsung.  This is an issue using the camera and viewing photos especially.I would make this my only phone except for the screen brightness and the 2x telephoto.My other phone is a highly regarded Samsung S23 Ultra which I would return were it not for those 2 issues.As it stands I am using the Samsung outside while walking and enjoying the OnePlus the other 80% of my day.Either phone would be a great choice as your only phone.I tried the Google PIXEL 7 Pro but returned it due  to pathetic 3.5 hour battery life.",5,B0BNWPSCGB,Color: Titan Black | Size: 16/256GB | Style: Phone,One Plus,Smart Phone

It failed to recognize any usb connection to share files, and did not work with Android auto (since it wouldn't recognize any usb connection other than charging the phone). After doing some research, I found out how to get into the developer setting and enable the usb recognition, so my Android auto connection began to work, but the every time I turned the car off and on again, I would have to restart the phone and update the usb setting again before the phone would recognize the usb connection. It was too much hassle for something that should just work automatically.  I saw in some forums that this is also the case with their version 10 phone, so it must be an issue with their most recent OS.

" April 2, 2023",Oscar S. Lozoya,Wired android auto not working.,So it's a nice device got it cuz my battery on pixel. But now I'm noticing this OnePlus can't connect to my aftermarket sony via wired connection tried three USB cables including one that came with phone. It asked u if I want to transfer android Auto but it fails everytime. My pixel 7 connected fine. I'm pretty sure there aware of this issue I've seen posts on forums about it. I spoke with representative and they set clear cache reset I've done all of it. Still not working paid a lot for this phone. I could upgrade my radio to a wireless one but I ain't plan on spending more. So I might return this device and just stick to my pixel 7.,1,B0BNWPSCGB,Color: Titan Black | Size: 16/256GB | Style: Phone,One Plus,Smart Phone

Once I ordered it, it arrived 4 days later which was quick and the box it came with had no damage so it was treated with care. It is also 1TB which is just what I ordered. My only complaint is that the power brick it came with was on off brand brick and it look cheap and lite weight and that is something I wouldnt use to charge on my iphone. Honestly, I would never use it, I would just put it on the side. And lightning to usb-a will not cut it for the necessary data speed for using cameras that big and the charging will be very slow for a big battery it uses. Shouldve include lightning to usb-c.

I had no plans to use the included charger, but it's there and works for those that will. The SIM removal tool is also nice to have if you're switching phones.On first look, it was practically new and free of any scratches or scuffs. Then after charging it and setting up the phone, I looked and saw it had 100% battery health. Honestly expected near 80-85% based on what other refurbished shops offer, but I was pleasantly surprised.I've got no complaints so far, very snappy and the high refresh rate is great to have.

It has totally plastic build which sometimes leaves little white mark if it hits across forcefully across the wooden frame of your door. So you have to be careful while putting it in a backpack and turning fast. Thankfully nothing happened to the screen as it hit next to hot air vent.

Forget about gaming, when I keep my 100% screen brightness and stay connected to internet and just browse videos without using laptop speakers it lasts only about 2.5 hours that's a bit disappointing.

But DLSS 2.0 should help on future games for med/high settings within 4GB of VRAM.All heavy apps which use CPU will run like a charm in it. I dont use those software but saw extremely fast game installs which generally do lot of unzipping.Alienware software which gives CPU/GPU temperature and fan speed is also responsive vs what's being mentioned in online reviews.2 x 8 GB Ram = 16GB RAM is based on 1Rx16 memory and is slower compared to 1Rx8 based modules. I didn't knew this while buying or when i first posted this review. since it is good enough for my usage i dont care to upgrade it in future to 1Rx8.you may need to do some fan speed adjustment as fans can get loud during heavy task. but that happens will all other laptops as well.Another issue is idle temperature are ~60C but since fans doesn't kick during these idle state (as per dell design choice), the temp will be high only ~ 60C. It can be tweaked using alienware control panel.boots in few seconds with the 512GB ssd.Battery life is ~2-3 hrs with performance mode on, cant expect much from gaming laptop. But it can be increased by going to battery saver mode and reducing brightness.1080p Display is good with 120Hz refresh rate and colors are vibrant(65% sRGB). Brightness is only 250 nits so outside use may not be good. Somehow all online review videos say screen is bad but i dont see why.Overall build quality is good but since there are air vents at the bottom, you may not want to put it on lap for extended use.Only con is the laptop color is somewhat white/grayish without any shine. This people may not like so much but i dont care about color at all.Just side note, if you dont want brand, these same specs are available in Acer/Asus/MSI for atleast 5-7K less. But since i was worried about after sales service in India so i choose dell.Notebookcheck video has more details as well.https://www.notebookcheck.net/Dell-G15-5515-5600H-RTX-3050.573464.0.html",4,B09F3QNCY3,Capacity: 16GB DDR4 RAM | Style: Ryzen 5-5600H,DELL,LAPTOP

21-Nov-22,Harish joshi,The issue with Power Plug,"I would skip the common things about MSI Crosshair like Gaming performance, Battery life, Display , Graphic card etc etc . Because if you are thinking of buying this you would have already seen many youtube videos for the same.I am here to notify the issue i am facing after using it for more than a month now.So the only issue i faced was the Power Plug it has in its charge. Usually in House we provide these type of plug in Kitchen and Washroom, Because of that i have to buy an extension for the charger.Now the main issue - It is the current that i feel when i connect the charger to the laptop. The entire body has a vibration/Current that no one is able to fix. The mouse gets lighten up without even turning on the laptop which clearly confirms that it has a current. I have asked so many people about this but no one could have an answer. I hope this Vibration or current won't affect my laptop later on.Other than this everything else is great about this MSI Crosshair.If anyone know how to fix this please respond.Thanks.",4,B09Y8SMYRS,Color: Black | Pattern: Gaming Laptop,MSI,LAPTOP
14-Aug-22,Kishor Kumar,This laptop performance is upto mark Battery life is very low,"There are both positive and negative aspects of the laptop but the negative aspects overlap the positive sides.For example1) The screen is super wobbly, it wobbles a lot when kept under a room fan which is extremely annoying .2) The trackpad is very average  the left button is faulty and has a very bad sound and feel to it3) The keyboard has a noticeable flex to it.4) The entire surface is prone to getting dirty.5) The battery life is awful even with integrated graphics and power saving on.(about 3 hours from full charge when you use the power saving setting and igpu, otherwise normally less than 1.5hrs).---> Very important the MSI CENTER software is extremely buggy. It was frozen even after reinstalling it 2 times. Once it was fixed it begin to frequently hang and freeze. for those who have bought the laptop and are facing the same issue it usually fixes if you end its task through task manager.plus the laptop mildly lagged or glitched for a second or two not only the MSI Center but other apps too  which is concerning because it is a new laptop and it is supposed to be snappy.There are a few good things too the display felt above average and the camera, microphone, Bluetooth and wifi were great the fan  noise on turbo was negligible.If MSI works on above mentioned aspects this machine will be a very good choice compared to others. But as of now i am very disappointed with above mentioned issues.",4,B09Y8SMYRS,Color: Black | Pattern: Gaming Laptop,MSI,LAPTOP
21-Sep-22,Agooro,Keep your expectations average!,"The build quality of this laptop is not sturdy. You need to handle it carefully though I do not mean it is fragile. The backside of the screen/cover is a smudge magnet. Performance wise it is ok but here and there you will find optimization issues with windows 11 like the control center will initially hang and the entire screen will blackout while the laptop changes between discrete and integrated GPUs. Expect this laptop to go temperatures high above 92 degrees Celsius. I am using this for the past 3 weeks and found out about these issues. If dig deep and do some tweaking in windows services, the CPU usage issues kind of problem will be gone and the laptop will work optimally but the temperature is an issue especially if you are into some heavy CPU & GPU tasks like gaming or rendering. You will need to put the 2nd fan ON always if you are doing those heavy tasks. Battery backup for this laptop is very minimal don't expect it to cross 1.5 to 2 hr.",4,B09Y8SMYRS,Color: Black | Pattern: Gaming Laptop,MSI,LAPTOP
03-Oct-22,Buyer,Very powerful but bad battery and smudgy,"I bought gaming laptop after going through tons of laptops in market.Let me share what I found.In terms of 3060 laptops this is very strong only contested by ASUS TUF's A-15.A-15 is ~1,00,000 Rs. and this is 1,14,000 Rs.Difference of 14k Rs is for the 512Gb extra SSD and the QHD 2k display.The A-15 has better battery though and this one has only 53WhrDont expect this to go without charging for more than 3hrs. But when plugged in this is too powerful for the 140 W TDP power it dishes.I think the 1Tb SSD is warranted in today's day and age and is worth spending a little more.Also some ppl told me the color is not very good but as someone who plugs this to monitor its not noticeable .Actually I liked the color to be honest. its not bad.Also the material used for making laptop is very smudge prone. Im looking to buy a protective skin for the same.Overall I would recommend to buy this if battery life isnt issue (mostly for someone who uses laptop as one place thing) If you're someone who's always moving and wants a gaming laptop thats a contradiction.Powerful laptops come at this cost.Also if you can get a 3070 within 1,20,000 Rs. thats way better with a 10th or above gen intel processor.",4,B09Y8SMYRS,Color: Black | Pattern: Gaming Laptop,MSI,LAPTOP
24-Jul-22,Stephenopolis AnimodolisStephenopolis Animodolis,Literally a beast,"I have been searching for a latest 12th gen Intel Laptop and this is probably the best you can get (although there are a lot of other options from MSI but this is worth considering as it has a 140w TGP GPU). If you dont mind the rainbow six theme, this is a beast. Fluid experience with the fast processor and awesome gaming experience cause of the 2k screen and 3060 gpu.If you range is around 1.2L this is the one.",5,B09Y8SMYRS,Color: Black | Pattern: Gaming Laptop,MSI,LAPTOP

14-Jan-23,Ghanshyam SonowalGhanshyam Sonowal,Definitely tougher than the TUFs,"For the price it goes for during the sale, it's definitely a bargain. The 140-watt TGP GPU, the 12-generation CPU, and the QHD 165hz screen are what you pay the price for. It's definitely a beast of a machine, which will be enough for your day-to-day activities. There are a few shortcomings, but every laptop in this price range has something or other to complain about. But if you are looking for a more powerful device and can stretch your budget a little more, then go for the RTX 3070 version, as it's going for Rs. 1.36 lakh in most of the retail/e-retail sites, which I see as a much better bargain. But none the less, the RTX 3060 will suffice for most people's needs.",4,B09Y8SMYRS,Color: Black | Pattern: Gaming Laptop,MSI,LAPTOP

Not for gamers.8GB RAM+ 256 ssd is really working fine even with celeron professor .Build Quality -  5/5 very beautiful, Thin and light weight Black hard Plastic Body you can not expect Matel body in budget price range.Display- 5/5 Very bright anti glare but not support full HD as i think but it's quite fine I m happy  .Battery Backup- 5/5-  6-7 hoursPerformance- Very smooth And not much heating after continuously using 7-8 hours office work.My Rating 5/5 for daily uses. one day late delivery by Amazon but it's covid period so it happen but due to late delivery I got this laptop on ospecious day of Akshay Trutiya. 😊",5,B0928TF49H,Style: Celeron + 8GB RAM + Win 10,HP,LAPTOP

26-Sep-21,Amazon Customer,Not a good product... Not worth it.. Don't buy,"I had bought this laptop in may 2021 and now it's the ending of September 2021..so this review of mine is based on my experience of using this laptop for 5 months and I have noticed a few pros and cons in this laptopCons :-> heats up very quickly... Within 10 mins of use and heats a lot>hangs very frequently... And slows down immediately if 5+ apps are in use> ALEXA doesn't activate on voice command> while using the laptop, if u wanna shift ur place... Then if u carry the laptop with one hand when its screen is on... Then the screen goes completely black.. And u have to restart it> waking up the laptop from sleep or switching it on when it's shut down takes a lot of time... Sometimes u can feel anxious as it takes more then 5 mins just for the laptop screen to light up.> bad battery life... Charge doesn't really last for more than 2 hrs... Requires frequent chargingI have online classes for like 8hrs and this laptop keeps hanging most of the time during my classes.. And evn the battery life doesn't last so long... Requires frequent charging.. And heats up a lot while charging... So I can't use any much applications like chrome, adode pdf readers and Ms word for taking notes or searching info while I have my classes going onPros : -> affordable option for all those who want a laptop for minimal use> the speakers are quite good.. Loud enough for daily useSince this laptop works on Intel Celeron n4500 so can't really expect much performance like the ones which work on the intel i3, i5... Etc seriesSo I recommend u guys to not go ahead with this laptop... Evn if it looks affordable... This laptop doesn't offer any much features..Anyone who wants a laptop just for very minimal use can go for this... Else pls don't buy this laptop.. It's not worth it",2,B0928TF49H,Style: Celeron + 8GB RAM + Win 10,HP,LAPTOP

07-Jun-21,Vipul Anand,Under performing laptop...,"If this pandemic wasn't enough...now there's this laptop that costs about rs30000 with a clock speed of mere 1GHz...in 2021!!!.If you are looking to game on it or use it for video editing, 3D modeling/animation and stuff...there are better options out there that provide much higher clock speeds (2.5-3.5GHz) under 30000rs...Acer aspire 15, hp ryzen3 3300u are some of them...And they've got options for an m.2 nvme with upgradable ram upto 16GB... With a storage of 1tb hdd (if you're into data hoarding).Fun fact: an SSD does not increase your laptop's performance. It just speeds up your boot time and data transfer....If you're into performance laptops in a budget... remember ALWAYS check the processor speed/clock speed first. If its low, it doesn't matter whether you have an SSD in it or a 2600MHz or more frequency ram....it will perform poorly and lag under heavy tasks...So don't waste your money on this ... There're better options for you out there...",2,B0928TF49H,Style: Celeron + 8GB RAM + Win 10,HP,LAPTOP

10-Jun-21,Sanjay sinha,Good value for money,"I researched a lot. This laptop has the best features in the below-30-thousand segment.As regards heating issues, it can be minimised by keeping the laptop on a hard surface such as a table without tablecloth. If you wish to use it for heavy computational requirements, on a bed, keep two books (or something else) below it, at the left and the right sides, so that ventilation at the bottom is not hindered. Or, just tilt it and let its front side rest on your foot.It is advisable not to play games on this laptop continuously for long durations, as it may cause heating issues.

07-Jun-21,Mahesh,Good Laptop at reasonable price,"Review after 3 months.Laptop was working fine till Sept 6, had issues with wi fi adapter and reached out to hp support on watsapp and did what they said to resolve it. Ended up with the dreaded windows blue screen. Now the laptop throws up 'critical process died' error. Not sure how this is going to be resolved, hp is pathetic and deaf to customer complaints. So lesson learnt - don't trust HP brand, they treat customers like door mats.Day 1 Review -1. On Time Delivery & Packing by Amazon. 5 stars for the on time deliveries & proper packaging on every order.2. Windows is installed & set up is smooth - takes around 10 minutes.3. Laptop is light weight.4. Office Home & student is installed and only needs to be activated.5. The laptop speed is a pleasant surprise, booting is quick, multi tasking is smooth - possibly because of the 8gb ram. Excel, word, ppt, opens quick without lags observed in a budget laptop.6. Display is decent given the price.7. Charging is quick and took an hour to charge from critically low to 100%.8. Keypad is fine.Highly recommend this laptop for daily browsing, working on MS office.",5,B0928TF49H,Style: Celeron + 8GB RAM + Win 10,HP,LAPTOP

24-Jan-21,tech geek,It's alien technology,"Pros:-1. It's Superfast. It will feel fast on everything - from bootup, to app opening, to builds etc.2. It's slim. Air has no fan hence it's form factor is even slimmer than Pro.3. It remains cold even during heavy code builds. It's hard to find things which makes it warm actually.4. I have tried several graphics heavy games and they run great without any heat as well5. If you are just browsing with Wifi on, typically it loses 10% battery in 7-8 hours. But it's for Safari browser. It has achieved I guess what people will call power-efficiency nirvana.6. Screen, Sound and Mic quality are awesomeCons:-1. Since it's winters in India now, some people might not like that it doesn't heat up the surroundings2. For longer workloads - like if you are doing daily large video compressions/conversions and that takes like 15-20 mins, then this machine will not work as fast as Pro; as that's not the load it's optimised for. But ask yourself - whether you are gonna do that at all.3. Camera is 720p and that sucks about every other laptop as well. But Apple has brought some software optimisations which will make it look better4. It doesn't make sound of fan, so you might feel asleep if you are used that to keep track of your ML jobs.Apple started a revolution with this.

18-Aug-21,Nomadic,Don't Buy Apple Products from Amazon,"Ordered the M1 Air on 5th August and got it delivered on the 7th. Then on 18th noticed a black/grey spot on the display... quick google search revealed this as a dead pixel and quite common with M1 Macs. So I called up Apple and they offered me two options, either a new replacement Mac or full refund since mine is still under 14 days. As soon as I revealed that I purchased from Amazon, the Apple sales team said sorry they can't help me since Amazon is not Apple authorised seller.I'm never buying another Apple product from Amazon again. If you want the full Apple experience like seamless replacement, refund or after sales then you need to buy it from Apple or from any of its authorised sellers.

19-Jan-21,ashishashish,M1 8gb vs 16gb confusion?,"Should i buy the 16gb ram from apple store? This was the question i had for a long time. After going through tons of videos that compares 8gb air vs 16gb there was a clear evidence that with my use i can still be happy with the m1 8gb ram variant.This is not a long term review but i shall update the review after few months of usage.Why i opted for 8gb ram?My use is browsing some secure pages, maybe watch some videos too. Use imovies to edit small videos (not heavy 4k long videos as such) but i have seen that this can support even editing 4k videos. But then definitely if you are someone who use it majorly for editing 4k videos then you should probably get the 16gb variant. Then i do a little bit of coding too.I do have a office laptop that is a 16gb ram intel one. I did try opening some youtube 4k vids in chrome and compared it side by side and initial impression is pretty good on how the m1 takes on the load. But I should wait for more to get the actual picture.So, if you are light user with basic use and not into gaming or anything. This laptop is gonna be more than enough for your use. As its very much portable and light weight. The battery is also heavily optimised. ( i tried all these and i am yet to do my initial charging 😊).I shall update my review after 3-6 months for a better comparison.***update after 10 months *****No regrets! This is super fast engine. I do a lot of coding now with this. I feel every software works like a charm in M1 now. Of course we have the updated processor now.

It is dead within 3 days.Amazon please do something! After spending such fat money i can't bear any tension running behind service center. And the apple service center in patna.. omg they lost the ability to hear from their customers long back. And once you contact apple then they will tell you that apple is not responsible for the products sold by any third party website. The max they can do is to repair the system i mean really man?

05-Jun-21,AshishTAshishT,Very reliable and worth of each penny spent,"Hi, I have been an apple user- still have an old 2011 model. Then i switched back to dell for around 4 years. It's all good and smooth with Dell. And very recently I thought let me buy myself an Air. I like that its super sleek and somehow grey color is one of my favourites. So no surprizes the laptop comes in a nice packaging, (thanks to amazon for there on time and easy delivery). The only con of apple air is that its pricey but yes (if you are like me-you will realise its soon that in a long run, how this becomes such an important part of your life, its much more cheaper in value)Super Pro's1. M1 processors are highly efficient in processing. Also thanks to SSD2. Battery life is crazy- last for 15-16 hours easily3. Look and Design (there's not much to say- its very obvious)- Super classy, sleek and very light weight.Con's1. No consIt's the best version of any Macbooks till date.To be honest, I do multiple things- I design, I edit videos, I code, and I browse. Everything is good. I wish I could have ordered a bigger storage one though which was a bit expensive for me. So I treated myself with a very handy Seagate SSD 500 GB and I use it on the fly. Something extra to carry but I still LOVE it.Also, to let you know that- this is one of my first review that's written so throughly. So understand the excitement and satisfaction level of this product.WISH YOU LUCK! Now go and Buy. :)",5,B08N5W4NNB,Color: Space Grey | Capacity: 256 GB,APPLE,LAPTOP

14-Nov-22,Dhineshkumar,Awesome Product,"i was using macbook air early 2015 before. It was performing ok since i purchased until 2022. But i started facing unexpected shutdown due to poor battery condition. hence i upgraded to M1 Mac in exchange offer. I got around 18k exchange value which was surprising for me.After i started using this i fell in love with this due to following pros1. Excellent battery life (mora than 12 hours continues usage)2. Excellent performance compared to my previous macbook 2015 model (more than 200% bump in performance i felt)3. Excellent display qualityI did not feel any cons during my usage on past 6 months. Only concern is screen is ultra-fingerprint magnet. You need a cleaning cloth always with you which I am carrying with me all the time with IPA liquid for better cleaning performance. But i did not felt about it compared to the performance it was given. Also fingerprint wont be noticeable if the screen is onI thought of buying a screen card for mac (actually I purchased on amazon) to protect form fingerprint. Luckily it was damaged on transit. After that again I did some research and found lot of articles was saying using screen card will void display warranty of mac and screen card will eliminate the small gap given between the screen and keyboard while it closed which will lead to lid will not close properly or addition pressure will be put on screen while it closed which may damage the screen. Hence, I claimed refund instead of replacement product and purchased IP liquid to clean the screen.If you're a frequent traveler along with MacBook, you may notice keyboard marks on screen which may become permanent if it's not cleaned periodically. So, I purchased IP liquid and microfiber cloth to maintain it. It costs me around 200 for both (250ml vetro power IP liquid in amazon and microfiber cloth from DMART). I believe this will last me at least for a year or 2 which is sufficient for me to get another pair of this cleaning product instead of buying 1000+ rupees screen card. This liquid is useful in cleaning my other gadgets as well also during the Screen card installation on my own with cheaper option available online compared to products available in local market with 200+ rupees which is available online for 100+ rupees",5,B08N5XSG8Z,Color: Gold | Capacity: 256 GB,APPLE,LAPTOP
15-May-22,abhishekabhishek,If you're a student go for it .,"It's a very laptop 💻 but here are some of my observations.Screen: The screen is realy amazing movies watching and whatever task you do like reading PDFs, browsing images etc. It's a pleasant experience to eyes .Battery: Although they claim for 15-16 hours of battery life but in real time usage this has been a lot less than the claimed.On the first initial days I was getting about 8-9 hours of battery life which I guess is still good in this price range .i thought there is any manufacturing defect in my air's battery hardware. But the screen brightness and the task you're performing plays important role in deciding battery life of the laptop.On less than 50% brightness and very light task I was able to get around 12 hours of battery backup and I'm happy with that .Performance : I'm an engineering student and do a lot of development work . So if you're into development you can blindly purchase it . The productivity it provides is justifiable to its price .Keyboard and Trackpad: This is probably the best trackpad in the laptops not comparing it with pro macbooks but better than almost all windows laptops. However the keyboard can be considered a very good keyboard but not the best . But it gives you a satisfactory feeling of typing.Verdict: It's been a month of using this laptop and I'm very satisfied . Will update this review after 2 months.",4,B08N5XSG8Z,Color: Gold | Capacity: 256 GB,APPLE,LAPTOP

The M1 chip is a game-changer and offers unparalleled speed and efficiency, making it a joy to use. The 13.3-inch Retina Display is stunning and provides crisp, clear visuals that are easy on the eyes. The laptop comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD Storage, which offers ample space to store files and run multiple applications without any lag. The Backlit Keyboard is comfortable to use, and the FaceTime HD Camera provides clear video quality for virtual meetings.One of the standout features of this laptop is the Touch ID feature. It is incredibly convenient and makes it quick and easy to unlock the laptop without having to remember passwords. This feature, combined with the overall speed and efficiency of the M1 chip, makes for a smooth and seamless user experience. Additionally, the laptop works seamlessly with iPhone and iPad, making it convenient to share files and work across multiple devices.However, there are a few drawbacks to this laptop that led me to give it a 4-star rating. Firstly, the laptop tends to heat up quite a bit during intensive tasks, such as video editing or running multiple applications simultaneously. This can be quite uncomfortable and sometimes even affect performance. Secondly, the battery life could be better, as it drains fairly quickly during heavy usage. This is a bit of a letdown, as one of the key benefits of the M1 chip was supposed to be its efficiency and battery life.Finally, the lack of ports is a bit of a drawback. The laptop only comes with two Thunderbolt 3 ports, which means that users will need to purchase additional dongles or hubs to connect other devices. This can be inconvenient and adds to the overall cost of the laptop. Additionally, the absence of an SD card slot is a bit of a bummer, as it is a commonly used port by photographers and videographers.In conclusion, the Apple 2020 MacBook Air Laptop with M1 chip is a great investment and offers a lot of features and benefits, but it does have some drawbacks. It is a powerful and efficient machine that is great for everyday use, but it may not be the best choice for professionals who require more intensive applications. Despite the drawbacks, I would still recommend it to anyone in the market for a high-performance laptop that offers speed, efficiency, and convenience.Bullet points:The M1 chip provides unparalleled speed and efficiencyThe 13.3-inch Retina Display is stunning and provides crisp, clear visualsThe Backlit Keyboard is comfortable to use, and the FaceTime HD Camera provides clear video qualityThe Touch ID feature is incredibly convenient and makes it quick and easy to unlock the laptop without having to remember passwordsThe laptop works seamlessly with iPhone and iPad, making it convenient to share files and work across multiple devicesThe laptop tends to heat up quite a bit during intensive tasksThe battery life could be better, as it drains fairly quickly during heavy usageThe lack of ports, particularly the absence of an SD card slot, is a bit of a drawback",4,B08N5XSG8Z,Color: Gold | Capacity: 256 GB,APPLE,LAPTOP

09-Jul-22,Ben,Longterm review Fanless Wonder,"I had fears about getting a laptop with passive cooling, even though I don't do video editing or compile big programs on the Air, even for web development and writing small scripts a fanless laptop seemed like a bad idea but after using this I can this thing is totally fine and wonderfulDocker works fine some issues do come up but for simple development of C++, Python apps along with Postgres SQL docker with some configurations the M1 chip has so far caused no issues.I run vscode, pycharm the project is not too huge but with safari or chrome running with 6-8 tabs this wonder does not heat up or cause any instability.The display is the best I have used so far, the speakers are far better than equivalent windows laptopsSome Cons:1) No simple keyboard shortcut to control keyboard backlighting,2) As a long-term windows user, the shortcuts like arrow key + Win key to resize apps/stack apps is something I truly miss, Mac does have its own multitasking/split screen way but I prefer windows installing a third party for this seems unnecessary3) Battery life on 12.4 is a bit less than when I got the MacBook Air4) Switching to Mac shortcuts takes a bit of time5) Need to buy a type C Dongle, as I work of ethernet port mostly",5,B08N5W4NNB,Color: Space Grey | Capacity: 256 GB,APPLE,LAPTOP

12-Feb-21,Moinak C.,Best laptop in the market today!,The M1 based MacBook Air is simply the best laptop you can buy right now. With the MacBook Pro also using the M1 it's the first time in years that the Air's specs are almost identical to the Pro's at a much lower price point. For those worried most common applications like Chrome are already available native for M1. Other non native apps also work flawlessly.Pros:1. Noiseless2. High screen clarity3. Battery life of 3-5 days on average use4. Very light5. Fingerprint sensor6. Keyboard is so nice you feel like typing moreCons:1.

16-Feb-23,chetndas,Good battery life and RAM management,"Got it for 80K in last sale after all discounts combined. Received securely packed, and brand new no issues there. Here are some pros and cons you may want to consider:1. Wonderful battery life: Most amazing feature of this laptop - can take it outdoors, with full screen brightness, and heavy workload (heavy programs running with 7GB / 8GB RAM used), it gives 8-10 hours or even more (haven't tried sitting all day outdoors).2. Great screen: Better than my Mi notebook pro, that too has good screen, but this one is brighter and crispier and the difference is well noted in bright sunlight.3. RAM management: I run chrome with 8-10 tabs open, heavy programs running that takes 14GB / 16GB RAM in my Mi notebok pro, this one manages it with 7GB / 8GB RAM. That's all. I felt some lag opening photoshop, 2-3 seconds delay clicking open button and actually opening of photoshop application, but I don't mind it. Comparing processing with my Mi notebook pro i5 with 16 GB RAM, this one is comparable.4. Light weight and slim: At cost of slightly smaller screen.Conclusion: This tool will get you through your general and programming needs with mac os.",4,B08N5W4NNB,Color: Space Grey | Capacity: 256 GB,APPLE,LAPTOP
09-Jan-22,Anubhav Nautiyal,Bittersweet experience,"This is my first Macbook. I needed a personal laptop with the following requirements -1. It should have long battery life. I should spend less time being anxious about battery and more time actually focusing on doing some work with it for long hours. This device makes you forget worrying about battery.2. It should wake up quickly/instantly from sleep, like how a tablet feels always ready to use. Imagine a situation when a question pops up in your mind that you've been encountering for long and thought of bookmarking it or letting it's tab sit on your open browser session, in such moments a mere 5-10 sec wake time will make you hesitant to reach your laptop, specially if ideas keep springing in your head multiple times a day. With Macbook, you open the lid and you're productive already!3. It should be fast while multitasking and switching tabs.I was initially skeptical with the 8 GB RAM thing, having experienced how quickly 16 GB fills up in windows with multiple browser windows and tabs open. Still decided to give it a shot, and man this thing doesn't disappoint.But it's not all perfect. There are multiple issues I faced -1. Using an external 2K 24-inch display delivers pathetic experience. The  rendered text is unpleasant to read and the icons sent are not retina versions, they look bad. Having been spoilt by the excellent ClearType on Windows and noticing minute visual details by habit, I have a very bothersome time everytime I wake it up. Dear Apple, please provide subpixel rendering or a ClearType equivalent, it's much needed. Though at present, there are some software workarounds that could help to an extent by rendering retina visuals on non-retina displays, for eg. BetterDummy (supports M1).2. The mouse pointer is annoyingly jittery. My setup goes like this - Lenovo Q24h-10 connected via USB-C to MBA, one USB port of the monitor's USB hub connected to Lenovo 300 FHD webcam, the other USB port (with support for USB BC spec) connected to an ORICO 4-port USB 3 powered hub (the external power is not connected though), and the wireless dongle of Dell KM636 connected to the hub. The setup works like a charm with Windows on a Dell Latitude, even with Samsung Dex, but somehow with the Mac, the mouse cursor is very jumpy and the experience is annoying to the point that it's unusable. Things are better if the dongle is connected directly to the other USB C port of the Mac though, via an adapter. They are also somewhat better after enabling some option related to power on the monitor's OSD, and using MOS software on Mac, but the jumpiness is still present.Rating it 5 stars for what it's designed to do.",5,B08N5T6CZ6,Color: Silver | Capacity: 256 GB,APPLE,LAPTOP
23-Apr-22,Amazon Customer,Pocket rocket this Laptop is,"I upgraded from a 2017 Acer Aspire Intel i3 Laptop (256GB SSD + 1TB + 8GB). And after the first day of usage, my mind is blown. Yes, I paid a hefty amount for the Air (Rs 76K with an exchange, Amazon took my old laptop for Rs 8800).Display: 13.3 inches may feel small initially for those shifting from 15.6 or bigger screen sizes. Honestly, I'm already used to it in a day. Unlike my Acer, the screen is brilliant. Great viewing angles, crisp and the brightness is adaptive. I don't have to keep adjusting brightness levels all the time, the sensor takes care of it. Speakers are excellent for this form factor, they even have a very mild base.Performance: It's off the charts. This M1 chip has 5nm transistor spacing making the laptop incredibly efficient. Plus it comes with 8 cores so multi-tasking is a breeze. I have about 10 chrome tabs, and 5 other windows open and it provided over 12 hours of battery life. Performance is flawless, it doesn't lag, no stutters, not even a hint of retard while navigating through apps.Keyboard and trackpad: Trackpad is large. You can adjust levels of trackpad sensitiveness to your touch. A nice feature to have. The clicks are very satisfying as well. The keyboard is backlit, and the key travel is perfect. Takes absolutely zero effort to get used to the keyboard and trackpad.OS: The laptop comes with Big Sur OS and right from the get-go you get the option to upgrade to Monterey which took about 20 minutes on my 50gbps internet speed.Lastly, Amazon delivery was good this time. I had ordered a Lenovo 2 months ago and Amazon took 10 days to tell me that the product was damaged in transit. However, this time, Amazon delivered my Macbook Air in 1.5 days.Update: The charger gets very hot and I can feel a very mild current (almost like a vibration) on the flap when the laptop is plugged in. This happened on my Acer also. Anybody else facing with this?",5,B08N5T6CZ6,Color: Silver | Capacity: 256 GB,APPLE,LAPTOP

I use the laptop for browsing, emails, watching content and MS office; all of this runs flawlessly on this machine. The design is beautiful. The photos don’t do justice to the actual gold colour. I brought gold because space grey wasn’t available even after a long wait but I’m glad that happened because this is a rose gold colour and it looks splendid.This machine is worth every penny even without discounts, but if you get it with some credit card discount or good exchange deal like I did, don’t wait at all.",5,B08N5XSG8Z,Color: Gold | Capacity: 256 GB,APPLE,LAPTOP

Its a premium quality machine with great aesthetics and immensely powered by the M1 chip. However, I was a bit disheartened when I came to know that lots of applications have blocked the M1 chip and you cannot install them in this machine (like Instagram, Netflix etc). Overall it might look a costly one to buy, but if you are okay with MacOS then this is the best thing that comes in 93,000 INR. Dell XPS with similar configuration is costlier than this.

The display is top notch with great viewing angles and good brightness levels. The output from speakers is a melody to your ears. I won't say a word about the chip. I think even after m1 pro is released, this would be the one that will sell in numbers because former would cost around 2 lakh in India. Most of the softwares are now available for Aarch64. I am a developer and still haven't installed Rosetta 2. Recommend to use Safari as your daily browser as it saves a lot of battery life and it's blazing fast.

19-Nov-21,Kamala gudeKamala gude,The best!!,"The hardest part about buying a macbook air or any apple product for that matter is not worrying about the price, but choosing the colour.Initially, looking at the photos, I thought gold would look nice and unique but when I went to the store and checked it, it seemed to be very cheap and tacky. However, at the end of the day, it all comes down to personal preference.Anyway, this left me with two options, namely, silver and space grey.Silver seemed a little too plain and boring and it kinda looked like all the other models and was a bit over-contrasting. So I ended up picking space grey. Although people online mentioned it to be dull, when I went and checked it out in the store, it looked super classy.Before ordering on Amazon, I'd highly recommend you to first go to the store and check the colours out. Don't rely on the photos online.Also, don't be apprehensive about purchasing on Amazon cause u will get a genuine product. Make sure to check your serial number on the Apple website. Plus, to avoid scratches, refrain from using laptop bags with zips and avoid wearing watches or jewellery while using it.This is by far the best laptop I've ever come across. It's worth spending those extra 15-20k. Don't even think while choosing macbook vs windows. No windows laptop could ever come close to macbook air.Also, refrain from buying the latest macbook pros worth 1.5l+. They're so not worth the amount you're paying. Most features are exactly the same as air and there's no major difference except for the touch bar which is crap in my opinion.",5,B08N5W4NNB,Color: Space Grey | Capacity: 256 GB,APPLE,LAPTOP

If and if only Apple sells its Macbooks for Windows operating system, it would be really a 10 STAR device.Pros:* Excellent SOC (System on chip) which is beyond any comparison. Intel and AMD have been left milesbeyond. Their processors are antiquated & far short in performance.* The processor does not generate any heat - which indicates the cool operation and also low powerconsumption. There is no cooling fan in the laptop.

One C port is engaged forpower supply. Thus one has inflexibility of having to do with only one H.Speed ""C"" type USB port.* Windows users switching to Apple are cautioned.

05-Jul-21,Brensten Vaz,"A little overpriced in India, but worth the money as an apple product!","Skipping the technical part since I'm sure most know about the M1 chip already. As a first time Mac user, I would say, switching to Mac from Windows was a very good experience for me. I didn't face any major issues. All I can say is that for professional and non-gaming use, this device is a monster. 11 hours of battery life easily, with video calls and multiple tabs and apps, along with windows on parallels ON, the whole working day! I never felt that I lacked anything. Even when there were power cuts, you can easily tether your phone or even better if you have an Iphone, and still keep going as if the power is still ON.From performance to battery life, design, everything is amazing. But do know that you'll need to keep an extra 10 thousand rupees spare to get accessories which are essential, such as cover, hubs etc. But overall a great buy as a minimum 5 year investment, and you can still expect some resale value. I was bit disappointed with the Amazon delivery executive though, he simple left the item with the watchman without taking the OTP and he then calls up for it.

RAHUL BR,Worst Experience with Sony MDR-XB450AP EXTRA BASS Headphone,"I've Ordered  Sony MDR-XB450AP EXTRA BASS Headphone in Amazon. Product Delivery by Amazon was very Quick but the Product was not fulfilling my requirement. I've found 2 Issues.1. As per their specification, its having Fixed two-sided cord with AP remote for hands-free calls .but this is not working when i connect this headphone to my Redmi Note 4 Mobile.2. Head Phone is not connecting properly in Mobile. For getting the connection i have to do some minor corrections/adjustment which is highly disgusting.NB: The Price range Between Sony MDR-XB450AP & Sony MDR-XB450 model is around 400 INR . but if the extra function in Sony MDR-XB450AP (AP remote for hands-free calls) is useless , it is purely waste of money.So dear folks, think twice before buying these models.Thank you",1,B00SISQAX2,Colour: Blue,SONY,Headphones,

Its me,good mid range headphone,"I think this is the good headphone in many point of view like if we talk about price its price is not the lowest among the sony headphones (it means good mid range) .If we talk about its material quality it is made from some good quatily plastic (I think reason of using plastic in this head phone is to make it light weight(less mass)),its wire is very good and looking stylish (like strip) ,about the headphone cushion it is very soft which feels very comfortable in ear.. ,both the end of headphone compress our ears very gently.If we talk about sound quality it is nice ,it makes the sense of watching movies in theaters- very good. on the audio with bass it works very nice feeling like sourrounded DJ (head phone will give their performance best on wearing it properly)I am writing this review after 1 month of buying but as I have seen its review on youtube even after 1 year of using it nothing will happen with their body or cushion or spring nature etc.Lastly I will say that I will recommend to anyone one if this headphone is under your budget.thank you",5,B00SISEOLC,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

alter-egoalter-ego,Top notch in segment!,"These are my observations & feedback after using Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB450AP for ~ 1 week:+ MDR-XB450AP is a closed type, on-ear headphone with 3.94 ft long Y-type cord.+ sound quality is amazing, crisp and clear with boosted bass punch.+ looks are good, with classy metallic finish.+ build quality is sturdy and durable.+ headband is also sturdy and amazing. It is adjustable to suit your head.+ the cushioned ear-pads are comfortable to the ear which also helps to enclose or seal the music perfectly.+ noise cancellation works perfectly.+ it sports a tangle-free cable with looks durable, the length of the wire is perfect, neither too long nor too short, you can easily sport it outdoors.+ it is fold-able and easy to store, really portable.+ lot more comfortable than other headphones out there in this segment, not too tight and don't slide off easily.+ I didn't faced (yet) any issue of heating up of ears.+ one thing which I was interested in knowing but was not able to gather much details before purchasing, was the performance of mic. After using I can say it is really good and do the intended job perfectly. I use it for voice calls and all feedback I got from the other party about the quality of voice was always positive.+ now an important thing about the authenticity of the product as a lot of fake Sony headphones are in circulation in market. Sony has issued detailed guidelines on how to validate if your purchase is authentic. Posting a web link is not allowed here, so just search for the words ""microsite mdrcaution index.html"", most likely it will be the first link in google search results. Following are the three things you need to check and in my case I found all in place correctly, which confirms it is an authentic one with a July 2017 import date:>>>>> 1 year warranty sticker.>>>>> MRP sticker.>>>>> correct bar-code, ending with (E) or (IN)On the flip side:- bass can be overwhelming and little too much at times.- I did feel a little pain after 2+ hours of continuous use, but I would like to believe that is normal and a matter of getting used to it. Just want to highlight.SUMMARY => Overall, an excellent product in ~2K price segment. You can definitely go for it.Pictures posted for reference. I hope this helps.Should you need any further information, do leave a comment below, I'll definitely try to get back.",5,B00SISEOLC,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Banti DasBanti Das,Awesome Bass,The XB in the name is there for a reason. If you are a bass lover and have a budget of around 1800 just keep an eye on the price and go for it as soon as it starts retailing at 1799 or less. All I can talk about after using this headphone for 2 months is the bass because when the bass drops the earcups just vibrate around your ears and you realise what you've been missing when you used normal or even good quality earphones.The earcups are soft and comfortable to wear but on a hot and humid day in Kolkata it does get uncomfortable and sweaty. But that will be the issue with any headphone. Other than that its pretty comfortable though when you're wearing glasses it does hurt around your ears because of the extra pressure on prolonged usage.Playing PUBG was a bliss as the surround sound worked pretty good.All in all i am totally satisfied with my purchase.,5,B00SISQAX2,Colour: Blue,SONY,Headphones,
Amazon Customer,Headphones even your phone can drive!,"Overview:These are the best headphones I've tried. Totally value for money. I'm not an audiophile by any means but these can make everything sound fantastic and clear especially if you are one of those upgrading from those earbuds you get with your phones.The most striking ability is it can be driven by Sony Xperia Z phone to really loud (mind it enjoyable and not deafening) and enjoyable volume levels. I actually turned it down for comfortable experience. If you want it louder pc will do that for you.  The sound quality is almost same for both slightly better in my phone but pc volume compensates for it.The vocals are not compromised in any sense even in bass heavy music you can rejoice every word and tonality of the singer (Yes even old classic bollywood sounds good and not at all funny)The bass is just enough to make you feel good about the music you listen and will not give you a headache by being too boomy and ""blurring "" other frequencies. The jaw shaking bass of XB 450 BV version was just out of question as they produce more of physical vibrational bass rather than audible bass.The looks are eye catching..

Shivjeet Chopra,Average headphones,I bought these headphones majorly because of the brand - SONY... Was highly disappointed with these.The sound quality is ok..the bass is just too high and sometimes it gets muddy and over the top. I always love headphones with high bass but the sound should not be compromised just to enhance the bass. Voice clarity is ok..treble is ok...bass eats up the entire sound. Some songs in the hip hop genre sound pretty good..but when it comes to voice clarity ..it just fails to perform.These are pretty comfortable to wear. I have only one problem with these because the wires are attached to both the ears.. that makes it slightly uncomfortable and it gets slightly annoying after sometime. It is a personal opinion and others may not have any problem with this..but i kinda did.For this price tag..they are average. You can far better sound quality in Skullcandy Grind 2.0..which are in similar price range (difference of 300-400 bucks) or if you can extend your budget..then go for MEE Aifri Runaway (bluetooth and wired) headphones....Sound quality - 6/10Comfort - 5/10Looks - 9/10,2,B00SISEOLC,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

Very disappointed with amazon.I called amazon and they said they will replace for free, and if the second product is also defective then they will return my money. The second one came in 3 days and I handed over the old one to them. The second one was an unopened package, and working fine.Now PROS and CONS+ sound quality of this Sony MDR-XB450AP is at least TWICE as good as my old Sony MDR-ZX310AP.+ bass is strong and it just feels like the sound is coming from bigger drivers, which it is not.+ passive noise cancellation due to the tight fit and good quality pads is a bonus.+ build quality is very nice. feels like a premium product. It looks pretty too.+ flat cable, I dig it!+ when I increase the volume, the headphones just keeps giving more!+ the mic works but nothing special about it. But I didn't buy it for the mic.- as mentioned above, the fit is tight, and that can be a problem. Sweat + Pain after extended use.- if I am nitpicking it feels like it is missing something, in the mids and highs.UPDATE- I'd wear MDR-ZX310AP for a whole movie without taking it off but with this new MDR-XB450AP I'd giving my paining and sweating ears a break every 20 mins.VERDICTNot worth it since it is not comfortable. Ear pains after 20 mins of use. So the amazing audio quality is irrelevant. Do not buy.",2,B00SISEOLC,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Appy,Good bass and sound..But..,"I have been using this since 2 years now. Overall the quality of the headphones is fine. The bass is super punchy. Sound quality is good. However do not expect it to stay in shape for long. After 2 years of sparing use the headband has become loose. Also the gum holding the ear pads has come off and now the inner foam is exposed. This has not really affected its functionality but it looks shabby. I am wondering if the ear cups (cushions) can be replaced. In case someone has any idea do let me know..Update:3 years now and one of the earcups have come off. I took it to the service center just to check if they can replace both the earcups and to my surprise the response I got was really bad. Any damage to the earcup is considered as an accidental damage and even if it is under warranty, it won't be entertained. Mine was anyway out of warranty so I was ready to pay for the replacement but I was told that this is not possible. In fact any issue with the headphones/earphones after the warranty is not Serviceable and this holds true for any range of earphones or headphones you buy from Sony in India. (The lady told me that even if it was a 25k earphone the response would be same!!) I was in fact planning to buy a premium wireless headphone from Sony which after this experience I have dropped.",3,B00SISEOLC,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

U GU G,Best headphones in the range - Delivers what promises,"Been using these headphones for a little more than 2 months now and I am very much happy with them.Delivery:1. Delivery took quite some days but was delivered before expected date.2. The packing was good (have a look at the photographs).About the headphones:The bass output of these headphones is mind-blowing (listening to Swedish House Mafia while writing the review). I've used other low range headphones of my friend by Sony that promised high/deep bass but I was disappointed by them. I bet you won't use these headphones at full volume(don't worry about the sound output). You'll ""feel"" each and every beat.Microphone worked pretty well, no problems with that. Drivers' cushions are comfortable and the build quality is really good (that's what you expect for the price you pay).There's no noise cancellation in the headphones - neither does it promises on the official Sony website.It's not really a con you can't use them for long time - it starts to hurt. That's quite natural for ears that they'll start hurt if you expose your ears to high volume for quite a time. Use them correctly and it won't be a problem! :)",5,B00SISR4ZK,Colour: Red,SONY,Headphones,

I used these with my friend's mobie (lenovo k4 note), and the clarity and volume was same like the laptop. so i guess my phone isn't giving the headphones proper output. but still it sounds soo good.

Sreejit NairSreejit Nair,Meh 😑,"Good things:1. Packaging was good. The product was in good shape. Shiny red color attracts.2. The product arrived 2 days before the said day and time, so, 5 stars for that.3. Product is plastic but unlike other products, it doesn't seem to have received complaints of wear and tear of breaks frlm whoever recommended me these.4. It reduces the background noise to half the moment you wear it. That's a very good thing.Disappointing thing:In the name of extra Bass, not only it muffles the overall sound, especially treble, but when you use the treble boost equalizer setting to play a song, the clarity of lyrics is not good. I have received better quality sound in boAt Bassheads 900 wired heaphone that costs only 700 rupees. I have used this device on iPhone, Oppo, OnePlus and Sony phones, and found the quality to be disappointing. Worst part, YouTube doesn't have an equalizer setting, so you have to adjust with the extra bass muffled sound.Giving it three stars because a product far less in price such as boAt is giving unmatched clarity. People who need only bass in their songs and are okay with the clarity of the singer's voice muffled, will find it a good choice..",3,B00SISR4ZK,Colour: Red,SONY,Headphones,

This headphone is the best one of what I've owned. Its still intact, with no physical damage.Coming to Audio Quality.Audio quality is top notch, and though this is an extra base headphone, the notes and highs were clear.Bass is pumping and amazing, and even better if you tune it with an Equalizer.There is also a mic on the headphone which is crystal clear for calls and online chatting.The headphones are comfortable even after wearing them for a long time.They also look amazing with those shiny metal cups :)The noise cancellation is  also good, I can't hear most of the outer environment.This is one of the best on ear headphones at this price range and if you're looking for bass then go for it.Hit the helpful button if this helped you :)Overview :Audio Quality (Notes and Treble) : 8/10Bass Quality : 9/10Build Quality and Looks : 8/10Mic : 7/10Comfort : 9/10Noise cancellation : 9/10Overall Average : 8.4/10 (Great!)",5,B00SISEOLC,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

M.O.S.,These won out over every other set of headphones I tried,"UPDATE 3/13/23: I noticed another reviewer mention that the padding has given out some after a while and I will concur that this has been my perceived experience as well.  The padding flattens easily and I wish it was a bit more robust.  I wouldn't say that the speakers are poking my ear, but I do feel my ear being pressed slightly and it does lead to minor discomfort over time.  So I would say that the padding could definitely be better on these, and it should be at this price point.  I would maybe deduct a half star for this if that was an option, but since it's not, I'm keeping my 5 star rating.  I'm still happy with the sound, but I'll definitely be looking out for some better pads.Original Review:I'm impressed with these headphones. They are really good.  I will, however, call out from the beginning that you lose some functionality and build quality (potentially - more on that below) seen in more expensive headphones and even though these are ""only"" $150, I think it's a bit pricey. But I think good headphones are just ridiculously expensive in general.  With that out of the way, here are the headphones I tried in addition to the WH-CH720N: Sony XM4 & XM5, Sennheiser Momentum 4, Soundcore Q30 & Q45, and Technics EAH-A800.My main objective in getting new headphones was to get a serious sound quality upgrade from the Soundcore Life Q20s that I've had for several years now, and I was finally ready to pay $300-$400 for it if I had to.  I was looking for clear mids and highs with deep, clear, separate bass (think of the difference between a sound system with a separate subwoofer vs a sound system without that tries to pack the bass into the main speakers).  With the caveat that sound quality is subjective to the listener, here are my thoughts on each of the headphones I tried:Technics EAH-A800 - absolute garbage and a joke at their price. These didnt even merit more than a few minutes of listening.Soundcore Q45 - disappointingly uninspiring sound compared to the much cheaper Q30. They lack bass.  I spent very little time with these because I knew that I would take the Q30s over them without question.Soundcore Q30 - These are very good for their price (compared to the other options at that price). If I hadn't been willing to spend $300+ for the best sound, I would have kept these despite the fact that they powered off in the middle of calls (a problem I believe is specific to OnePlus phones based on my research). But compared to more expensive headphones, the Q30's bass was not as well defined/separated and it bled into all the frequencies, lending to an overall muddy sound - comparatively.  But these are good, and at their price point, I doubt you can find better headphones.Momentum 4 - These headphones had, hands down, my favorite bass signature; it was fantastically clean and able to hit impressive lows I could not hear in any other cans. The overall sound was very good, although I never could get them to sound as clear as I wanted once I experienced the 720's. The M4s have fantastic battery life.  Sadly, there were quite a few issues with the M4s.  They sound awful in wired mode - like, dont even bother, theyre that bad. Taking calls on the M4s was a very weird experience; its hard to explain, but voices sounded kind of echo-y, but in the sense that it was like the voice was everywhere around me to the extent that I was sure that everyone else in the room was hearing the voice just as clearly as I was.  I couldnt decide if I liked it or not - all I can say for sure is that it was a very strange experience.  The M4's had software bugs that I just couldn't overlook, such as the audio being out of sync with video when using aptx (I had to use the lower SBC format to get the audio in sync and this just didn't make any sense!). The touch controls and on ear detection were a bit of a hit or miss.  Software updates are unreasonably slow - like 20 minutes or longer.  They are quiet - I found that I had to crank them up well past 50% to get enough volume, but at the end of the day, it didnt really matter because they did get as loud as I ever needed and still had the ability to go louder.  And they are on the heavier side, which meant they didn't stay in place on my head if I looked down or up.  I actually ordered a second pair hoping that the software issues were a defect, but the replacement had all the same issues.  But that bass was so good I was tempted, even prepared, to overlook all of those shortcomings.  Until I tried the XM5's and the 720's.Sony XM4 - I'm sure these were great for their time, but their age is evident. The sound was muddy and uninspiring to me. I quickly moved on from these.Sony XM5 - these are good - very good. I would have kept the XM5's if the 720s hadnt been released just as I was comparing all of these headphones.  The sound is very close to the 720's, but just not quite as clear, though I think the bass may go a bit lower than the 720's. It really mostly came down to price when deciding between the XM5 and 720. The XM5's are feature rich with an excellent ambient mode (the best Ive experienced). ANC is good, but not at the level I expected for their reputation and really not significantly better than most other headphones. Compared to the 720s, Id say the ANC actually blocked out less noise, but the XM5s made almost no static sound with ANC on and that may have played into that perception because I think the slight static noise the 720s make might just be covering up the external noises that Im hearing more on the XM5s.  But getting the absolute best ANC was not the most important thing for me.  I liked the touch controls on the XM5s - it's easier than feeling around for the correct button. But is it worth the price? Not for me - I'll take the trade-offs of the 720's for the savings, especially since I think the 720's sound better.  But I can easily see how someone would buy the XM5s over the 720s if money is not an issue.Finally, Sony WH-CH720N - these really are best described as the budget version of the XM5s.  Remember how I mentioned that they sound very similar to the XM5s?  Yeah, sometimes I forgot which headphones I was wearing, they are that close (post EQ-ing them to the best sound I could get from them).  The ANC and Ambient modes arent quite as good on the 720's, they dont have touch controls (a positive or negative depending on the person), and they dont feel as solidly built (though I might argue that is only because of how incredibly light they are - they actually seem well built and there are no creaks, but their lightness is easily perceived as �cheap�).  The 720s dont come with a case and they dont fold (but the XM5s dont fold, either); not a big deal to me.  Not folding just means they have fewer breaking points and are less obnoxious to handle when off the noggin.  These live on my desk, so a case is not important to me.  For traveling, I prefer the compactness of earbuds anyway.  The auto off feature only works after they lose bluetooth connection, which for the majority of us, only happens if we turn our phone off or walk far away from the headphones.  So, not significant value there, though I do turn off my phone every night, so the headphones will at least shut off at night if I forget to do it manually, and that is good enough for me.  The 720s are strictly controlled with physical buttons that are well placed, though I find myself expecting the ANC/Ambient button to be on the back, not the front (dont know why, because it actually makes sense the way they did it), causing me to push the wrong button more than Id like.  And I wish the volume up and down were more distinct from the play/pause button.  The buttons are my only real (but minor) complaint, but I'm getting used to the buttons and will be fine in short order.  The 720s are slim compared to the XM5s and the M4s.  And did I mention they are light?  They are insanely light and extremely comfortable.  Most importantly, the 720s sound really good.  While they dont quite have the bass signature of the M4s, they are so well balanced and clear across all of the frequencies (without being harsh or sibilant) while still having great, clear bass that it could be argued that the 720s sound better.  I just kept finding myself going back to the 720s over every other set of cans.  These headphones won out over the rest from my limited (but targeted) comparison.  There might be better sounding headphones out there, but I haven't found them.",5,B0BS1QCFHX,Style Name: WH-CH720N/Black,SONY,Headphones,
jenjaine,Was impressed.Not so much anymore.,"Update 3/9so first Im going to say that I bought these with my own money before any reviews were out.  Didnt realize they were a vine product.  After a few weeks of use the padding has relaxed enough so that I can feel the drivers poking my ears.  I wear my headphones around 4 hours a day on weekdays and 8-10 hours on each weekend day. As stated earlier I have a smaller than average head, and my ears do not stick out.  I can usually adjust the cups to be lower, but I dont like them riding my jawbone.I wouldve have overlooked that because they do sound good, however they are now randomly disconnecting.  I use them for YouTube and Im literally 18 inches away and they disconnect. I check through the app and it shows a connection failure.  If I pause a video, again, they show connected, but the sound comes out of my iPad.  When I check the app it tells me there is a connection failure and to restart. While the sound is good I dont think I care to restart my headphones every 10 minutes. Maybe they dont like Apple devices? Im not sure.I originally bought the xm5s. I finally got them last week only to find they were quite oversized for my smaller than average head. The weight of them made matters worse as every time I looked down they flopped forward. I had to return them.I am not one of those fancy audio people but I know what I like. My previous headphone were the solo pro 3s and I do enjoy them. What I dont like is the pain my ears experience after about an hour of having them on.I wanted over the ear headphones and everything I read and all the videos I watched pointed me to the xm5s which ended sadly. I searched Amazon and saw these were a new model. Looked up what little I could find online about them and the consensus was these were the cheap version of the xm5s. Yeah, Im sold so I got them.Build:  They are cheaper feeling, not as bad as the 510s, but nowhere near the xm5s workmanship. But they are also not breaking the bank (as bad anyways, it still shocks me to see what headphones are going for nowadays). The sliding part is plastic reinforced by metal. Ill be honest.I am wondering how they will hold up.Comfort:Excellent. These are super light. I dont feel them resting on the crown of my head at all. There is no clamping on or around my ears. But the are secure on my head. The padding around the ear cups is decent and the cups are deep so most will not have their ears touching the speakers.Bells and whistles: these are old school, they have buttonsno swipe features at all. I like that because in my week of using the xm5s I discovered quickly that volume adjustment was hit or miss with response time. It might be that my hands are always cold, but in 6 hours of wearing these I have already mastered the buttons. They are very well placed and very responsive.App:  They are part of the Sony Headphone app. You get an equalizer and other customizable features including the ability to connect to two devices at the same time and it works great as I use the headphones for watching music videos on YouTube and Netflix. I use my phone to adjust the equalizer for the music playing on my iPad.Another feature on the app is you can set the headphones to shut off when not in use. I was excited about the auto shutoff feature. Not so much now. It is not sensor based nor is it based on when you devices screen shuts down. It is based on when you turn of Bluetooth. This makes it worthless to me and maybe a lot of us who do not ever turn Bluetooth off. I think it could have been done better.Noise cancelling:Im going to call this adequate. With my Beats Solo pro with ANC I cant hear anything. Not even someone yelling. These will drown out the hum of a fan pretty well, but they let in a lot of ambient noise (like my husband coughing in the next room right now!). Even the xm5s were not as good as the Beats. But the on ear style of the Beats may have something to do with that. So Ill stick to the xm5s comparison. I also want to say that there are supposedly 3 modesnoise cancelling, ambient and off. I have not noticed any difference between ambient and noise cancelling. There is no voice prompt to let you know which setting you are in. I will play some more to see if Im missing a setting in the app and if something changes Ill edit my review.Sound quality: (of course this is subjective to each person) Excellent out of the box and I could not say that about the xm5s. My first mission was to find the equalizer when I took them out of the box and tried them. Not so with these. The sound was nice. I still tweaked it but if I wasnt able to change it a bit, I would still be happy.Other:They do not come with a case. They do not fold. They come with an aux cord and charging cable, no charging block.Final thoughts: This is my fourth pair of headphones in a month. I was willing to drop over 300 bucks on a pair. And I didnt like any of them. Most important to me is fit and sound.  Most were severely lacking in sound quality.  These are not. And they were cheaper.I am most disappointed in the build quality. I think they shouldve done better. To me $150 is alot of money to spend on headphones that feel this plasticy. And if they crack after 6 months Ill be upset. Im not expecting $350 quality, but better. These are not too much better than the 510s when they shouldve been a little less than the 910s. They are far less quality than the 910s. Maybe Im asking too much after coming from the Solo 3 pros and xm5s which both have a superb build.BUT..they make up for it in having great sound that you can totally adjust to your liking.  They are comparable to the xm5s in sound. And far superior I feel to the 910s which just sound overly undefined bass. And the comfort!! Its spot on.These are the best out there in terms of sound and app capabilities.",3,B0BS1QCFHX,Style Name: WH-CH720N/Black,SONY,Headphones,

gabe f.,Better options for the price,"These sony headphones are exceptionally light, almost to the point they feel cheap. I have to fly a lot for work and was looking at replacement options for mySoundcore Q45s. Compared to the Soundcore the Sony headphones felt cheap. The padding around the headphones on the Sony uses a more �breathable� fabric, ear cuffs have a mess fabric, compared to the Soundcore which uses pleather. On long flights the Soundcore headphones can start to feel clammy.Other issues I had, these are personal preference but ended up being reasons I stuck with my Soundcore Q45s.Audio control notifications - On the Q45s anytime you change the setting normal, transparent, or ANC (Active Noise Canceling). There is an audio message that plays. This is helpful during travel where you find yourself needed to hear a little more. For example, when I am seated on the plane I have ANC on, but if I go to the bathroom I will change to normal which will reduce the noice but allow me to hear more clearly in case someone like the stewards need to pass by. The Sony headset does not have that feature, in order to know what setting youre in you need to have your device or memorize how many times you hit the settings button.Sound - The Sony headset sounds better with no ambient noise. Unfortunately do to its poor ANC you have go turn the volume up in order to hear clearly. When I am on the plane the idea is to reduce ambient noise. Planes or known for being loud and causing hearing damage when exposed for long periods of time. In the case of the Sony headphones I have to turn them up significantly louder in order to hear. Defeating the purpose I bought them for (reducing noise to hear better).Finally Sonys app leaves much to be desired. You have the option to change your mode: normal, transparent, ANC. And thats about it. They have some software that is supposed to adjust noise based on your ear and boost base but they seemed more of a gimmick then a feature. Sony does not allow you to adjust any of the settings for how strong the ANC is or what frequencies get passed through in transparent mode. On the Soundcore App, you can adjust how strong the ANC is 1-5. For transparent or Normal mode you can adjust frequencies responses. What this does is allows you to customize the filters. In my case I filtered out low frequencies on the plane. I dont want to hear the rumble of the engines. This allows the high pass frequency to be passed through such as voices.Sony has good Noise Cancelling headphones at the high end. Unfortunately this mid-high-end ($160) is not one of them. There are better options for less money. I compared to the Q45s as they are the most comparable in terms of price I have tried and are currently my go-to during my travel. These feel and perform like sub $100 headphones not $160.",3,B0BS1QCFHX,Style Name: WH-CH720N/Black,SONY,Headphones,
Quoad ToadQuoad Toad,"Good, budget friendly choice with great sound quality","This is my second pair of Sony noise canceling headphones.  My other pair is the WH100XM3.  The CH720N headphones are a much more budget friendly option than the other.  They are a great option if you don't have the budget for the more advanced model.I am really happy with the sound quality.  They do a good job of blocking ambient sounds.  I haven't traveled with them yet, but at home, they do a good job when there is noise outside and I need to concentrate on work.  They are light weight compared to the WH100XM3, so they are easier to wear for a long period.  The WH100XM3 end up hurting my ears where my glasses sit quicker than the CH720N.  This model also fits a bit looser on my head in general.  As can be seen in my picture, the black pair (CH720N) is wider than the silver color pair (WH100XM3).  The latter has more foam padding overall.  The CH720N has no padding on the speaker part, so it has a little more tendency to hurt my ear than the other pair.  The tighter fit of the WH100XM3 contributes to the sound cancelling being a little better than the CH720N.The noise canceling seems a bit better on the WH100XM3, but there is a steep cost to go with it.  I find the WH100XM3 are easier to control with its touch sensitive exterior headphone part that can skip, pause, and play music.  The CH720N is controlled with little buttons.  I adjusted, but it wasn't instant.I was able to quickly connect the CH720N to my phone.  My laptop instantly noticed when I turned on the headphones and asked if I wanted to connect them.  I had to scan for Bluetooth to connect my phone and desktop computer.  Carrying on a conversation works well and my colleagues can hear me easily on a video call.I wish Sony had included a case with these headphones.  I like to keep my headphones in a case to prevent damage.  These headphones are an investment that I expect to last for years, so Sony should have included a case.  I recommend buying a case and not using the little bag that comes with these headphones.Overall, I recommend these headphones.  The sound quality is great and rivals more expensive options.  I felt like I could hear details of music that other headphones don't pick up.  The noise canceling is good and if you're an occasional traveler, the CH720N would be perfect.",5,B0BS1QCFHX,Style Name: WH-CH720N/Black,SONY,Headphones,
Michelle,I LOVE these headphones!!,"I've been playing with these headphones for HOURS this morning alone. When I first took them out of the box, they had a 60% charge on them. Plenty of charge to get set up and make connections and play around a bit. You do need to download the Sony Headphone Connect app to your phone, but that makes everything easy. Without the app, I couldn't seem to get the headphones to connect to two different devices at the same time (phone and computer). Loaded the app, didn't even have to set up an account (I just skipped each time it wanted me to do so) and easily linked the headphones with my computer. Also very quickly and easilyl linked with Alexa so now I can wander around and set timers, etc. without having to yell to the nearest dot/echo in whichever room it might be. Music sounds amazing (and if I get around to signing in for an account, there is a setting in that area that makes it even more amazing - check out the test of the audio in the app and see what you're missing). Sound reduction is really good, as I sat right next to the TV and rarely even noticed that my husband had it on. It doesn't obscure your hearing to the point that you wouldn't hear someone speaking to you in a normal tone of voice, but you may not notice it. A whisper would be totally obscured, I think.No carrying case for these headphones, but that's not a huge deal. The ear covers flip around so the entire thing lies flat (it comes in a very flat box), so you could always store it on a shelf inside that box for dust protection.I really have found NO serious drawbacks to these headsets at all. They seem just as good as sets I tried at a local electronics store for almost double the price.EDIT: These charge VERY quickly. Advertising that 3 minutes of charging will get you 60 minutes of playtime may not be far off. Charged fully from less than half so quickly that I was just checking on them for the status of the charge and they were at 100% again. Quick charging is amazing!",5,B0BS74M665,Style Name: WH-CH720N/White,SONY,Headphones,

Jerold K. Brown,Connectivity issues caused me to return this,Update 3/29 had to return. Connectivity issues did not get better. Another thing to add on top of what I have below is. When they would disconnect and reconnect the active noise cancellation would deactivate and my EQ settings would reset to default. Major issue leading to this items return. It wasn't always bad but it was not fixed within my return refund window. I would have liked to give them more time to update the software but didn't want to take the chance and got my money back for this product.Great when they work. I have seen two reviews mention the same issue that has me writing this review. They keep randomly disconnecting. It cant play music or videos for 5 minutes straight without disconnecting and reconnecting. I've googled this issue and this isn't the first pair of Sony headphones to have this problem. If it isn't fixed/updated soon I will be returning. It's a problem for Android and Iphone.,1,B0BS1QCFHX,Style Name: WH-CH720N/Black,SONY,Headphones,
heath brockway,"High quality sound, comfort, looks","I expect alot with a big name brand like sony...they didn't disappoint. Packaging and presentation is nice. The setup was easy using using the QR code on the inside of the box.From the top of the headphones having a plush padding to the the rotatable and angle adjust ear cups they give a really comfy feel fully encapsulating the ear. The padding rests fully around the ear not on it...leaving no pressure points for those who are Sensitive and are more apt to get the annoying ear ache these completely solve the issue.On the left you have the power button along with charge port.On the right you have noise cancel on and off.Further to the rear on the right of the headphones are the volume up down and between the volume up down is the multifunction play stop, ff, Rev, take callThe sound is vibrant and very clear even at max. The mids are good with bass being effective but over powering so if you like a ton of bass you can customize it as it does have a custom function in the app. Using without the app in stock mode bass is I'd say on the minimal side.The noise canceling function takes ambient sound down noticeably. You can tell the mics that are located on the outside of each headphone do their job well when used in both modes (amplify, and noise canceling).They're light enough and comfortable enough for extended wear even for me and I typically will notice the unwanted ear ache from wear after about an hour or two.What a comfy recliner does for your backside these headphones do for your ears.

Review Guru,Great option for the price range,"These Sony headphones are great and provide good audio quality and noise cancellation. I have a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4's and these are a way better value. I don't like the ear cups quite as much on these, but they are still very comfortable even after wearing them over an hour. The sound is great and I do not notice a quality difference between the two sets, though I will say I am no audiophile and I'm just a regular joe in regards to sound quality. The noise cancellation is almost as good on these, to the point where most likely wouldn't notice much difference between them.The Sony app allows you to customize some of the features on the headphones, including hooking it up to Alexa. I like that you can connect two devices at once to them, it makes for easy connections for your phone and computer, or multiple phones if you are like me having to have a personal and work device. You can pair even more than 2 with the headphones and then use the app to switch between which ones default connect as well, making it where you can use these easily for all of your devices.Overall these headphones are well worth their price, and put big competition to the Sony WH-1000XM4's. For under half the cost of the other headphones they offer a great value, since the other headphones were already worth their cost. With these it gives pause to spend any more since they offer so much here that most won't notice a difference going to the more expensive sets.",5,B0BS1QCFHX,Style Name: WH-CH720N/Black,SONY,Headphones,

Terry G.,"Super light....great sound, and ANC is top notch","Review is for Sony WH-CH720N Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones Bluetooth Over The Ear HeadsetI currently have several  pairs of headphones, and also the Sony WH-1000XM4's.  Do these sound as good as the XM4's, no, but the ANC is comparable, if not the same.  Do these sound good?  Yes, they do, but of course not as good as the XM4's.These are super light headphones!  I spend some time EQing them to get them exactly how I like my music, and sat for a couple of hours just trying very different music, so that I could get a good sense of how these perform.  They don't disappoint in sound quality.  They are so light, you almost feel like you don't have them on.  Bluetooth range is really good.  Paired them with my phone and walked around the house, different rooms and they didn't disconnect due to loss of signal.  All in all a good experience.Now....they don't' fold.  No case.  Sort of like a no frills pretty good pair of headphones that are incredibly light.  Would I take these on a plane?  Probably not.  No folding and no case, but I bet they would be super comfy on a long plane ride, due to how light they are.  Sony makes quality headphones, but not sure about this one.  I am not sure about use case.  If you want a good set of headphones to use around the house, I don't think you can go wrong with these for the price asked.  At one point I was listening to music in just about complete silence due to the outstanding ANC, took them off and couldn't believe the ambient noise I could now hear.  Fans were on, room air filter was running etc.  Put them back on....ahhhhh...silence again.  Wow.  Really impressive.  If these are in your budget, I think you would like them.  They are so light...which is a plus, but not sure on longevity due to the lightness.

Ryan BerardelliRyan Berardelli,Excellent contender from Sony. Good budget version of the 1000XM4,"These Sony CH720N are an excellent new offering from one of the best wireless headphone manufacturers on the market. They offer most of the performance of the high-end 1000XM4 but at a lowish cost of only $150.Build quality:The quality of all the materials on these headphones can only be described as premium. They are mostly plastic construction, but all of the plastic feels nice to the touch, and seems durable. The ear foam is extremely comfortable, and the headband applies just enough pressure on the head to be comfortable for very long listening sessions. In addition, the headband foam up top applies a gentle pressure on top of your head, with a good amount of adjustability. For me, the head pressure on these is perfect.Adjustability:You have a decent amount of extension on the headband, for various sized heads. I would say they err on the slightly smaller side, I have a pretty average sized head and I had to extend the adjustment half way. One big feature that is missing on these is the ability to fold. Wish they could, for portability.Battery life:Extremely good. I've been using these in noise cancelling mode exclusively and I've gotten 10hr of play time at about half to three-quarters volume, and still have about 80% battery left. I'm impressed. I have another pair of headphones with smaller drivers by Jabra that get about 40hr of battery life, and these are on track to be at the same performance.Weight:These headphones are surprisingly light, and you don't really notice them much on your head, they are not fatiguing at all.Sound quality:Another major winner here. The sound quality in these things is incredible. I'm pretty particular when it comes to audio devices, and own several pairs of headphones. My current best performing portable listening device was my Shure SE215 IEM's. These headphones have easily replaced those in terms of comfort, convenience, and sound quality. Bass is nice and punchy, and full. It could stand to be a little bit stronger, but overall it is very impressive, and even watching movies, I did not find them lacking. Mids are clear and clean, but sometimes vocal recitation can be a little weak, very very minor complaint there though. Highs are nice and crisp with absolutely no ear piercing clipping. The audio performance on these is stunning, especially for the price. I would be surprised if there is any other headphone out there at this price point that could outperform these.Overall thoughts:If this is your budget range, buy them. They're that good. The app is decent overall, with EQ, some sound settings, and 3D audio. Pretty neat stuff but I have not used all of it. I found that the adaptive condition sensing is not entirely accurate. Riding in the car for a long trip, I found it triggering the walking setting on occasion and switching out of ANC mode. Small qualm, I switched off the auto sensing for the rest of that trip. Oh one other thing. They do not come with a case or even a bag. Wish they did, but they aren't that expensive.",5,B0BS1QCFHX,Style Name: WH-CH720N/Black,SONY,Headphones,
Impavidus,"Good Sound, but Not Great, Plus a Pain to Set-Up","I received these Bluetooth Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones a week ago, and I am just OK with them.They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and have decent noise-canceling capabilities, similar to the competitor's brand I have.  The sound quality is good, providing a clear and balanced ""normal"" audio experience.  What I don't like about the sound: these headphones have an additional 360� audio immersion system/experience - that you must purchase with a subscription! As much as i would like to experience the sensation, I refuse to pay (monthly) for the technology that is already supported by the headphones. My loss of experience, Sony's loss of a 5-Star review.The other maddening thing about these was the set-up.  What ever happened to just connecting with Bluetooth?  Again, Sony has made something that should have been simple to do - hard to do.  You have to download an app and then create an account with (personal information) BEFORE you can connect these to your Bluetooth devices.  I just want to hear my music/Podcasts/etc. - and not be a statistic to a database.The built-in microphone is a useful feature, allowing for hands-free calling. However, I did notice that the microphone quality could be improved as it sometimes struggled to pick up my voice clearly.Lastly, the battery life was OK, lasting for about 6 hours after its initial over-night full charge.Overall, it's a ""Meh"" for me.  I like it when simple things are designed to operate simply.  The set-up was ridiculous, and having to pay for a monthly 'script to fully experience something for headphones that already cost a lot of money - makes it hard for me to fully endorse this product.",3,B0BS74M665,Style Name: WH-CH720N/White,SONY,Headphones,
Richard3107,Sound Quality Is Okay But Where Is The LDAC?,"The sound quality is okay, but it doesn't blow me away and is not that much better to my ears than other headphones I have owned that cost a lot less, so I don't see the value in these at all.  Maybe I would feel differently if I was listening to high-resolution audio over LDAC, but, apparently, $150 is not enough money to warrant getting Sony's proprietary Bluetooth codec.  Heck, they don't even have any form of aptX for that matter.  They just use basic SBC and AAC.

Another thing that I also noticed is that my husband used a Samsung Flip 4, and he never had problems losing connection while using it. while I use a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.�Previous Review:I love everything about this Sony wireless headphone. It's very comfortable, and the sound that it produces is amazing. This wireless headphone came nicely packaged in a box but didn't come with a case to store it.

Rich M8NY,Best noise reduction headset I've bought.,"The music is very clear with not using the equalizer. Bass is very nice, no need to boost. First time to use Blue-tooth, and it's very good. I can't wait to use it while flying.",5,B0BS74M665,Style Name: WH-CH720N/White,SONY,Headphones,
Jason,Connectivity Issues,"Headphones randomly started disconnecting from my phone and computer a little over a week ago. (I am assuming this is because of an update). Prior to this, I didn't experienced any connectivity problems. The disconnections happen frequently, and sometimes even after 20 minutes after use, which is quite frustrating. Other than that issue, I find these headphones comfortable and I think the sound quality is excellent. Once the connectivity issue is resolved, I will gladly update my review.",2,B0BS1QCFHX,Style Name: WH-CH720N/Black,SONY,Headphones,
A Mom with Kids and Fur Kids,So Many Pluses... but Not for Large Noggins,Pros:1) EXCELLENT  sound quality.  Very distinct bass response and brilliant middles and highs.  Clearly renders �stage presence� of live performances.2) OUTSTANDING noise cancelling.  These headphones block almost all outside sounds.  So much so that you will miss phone calls and calls for dinner time while you are wearing these.  Truly awesome for focusing on work or music in noisy environments3) These headphones are designed for iPhones.  Bluetooth connection with an iPhone was simple and worked well..Cons:1) NOT very comfortable.  Maximum use time of about an hour. They clamp tightly around the ears and seal so well that I got an earache from wearing them.2) Not suitable for running or working out.  Sweat accumulates under the ear cushions.3)  Headphones would not pair with my MacBook or Dell laptops but worked fine when connected via headphone jack.4) Not suitable for gaming or telework (besides the ear pain) because the microphone only functions over Bluetooth and will not pair with computers.CONCLUSION:  Pretty good sound reproduction and excellent noise cancelling but the lack of comfort combined with the Bluetooth and microphone idiosyncrasies will keep me from ever using these.  Get a good gaming headset like Arctis 5 instead.,4,B0BS1QCFHX,Style Name: WH-CH720N/Black,SONY,Headphones,
What I Think,Music I Can Feel With These Headphones,"If you can't afford Sony's flagship WH-1000XM5 noise canceling wireless headphones, this is the next best thing in my opinion.  It's the lightest wireless over the ear headphones I've ever had weighing in just under 7 ounces.  Despite its weight, the battery life is purported to last up to 35 hours even with noise canceling on.  I find in actual usage, this comes very close to what being advertised because I've been using it a few hours per day, and I haven't needed to charge it yet for over a week.  Also, it uses the same Sony's Integrated Processor V1 for noise canceling that's found in the flagship model.  So, it's kind of like paying less for more.  Not only is it lightweight, it's very comfortable to wear due to its super soft ear pads.  I could wear these headphones hours on end and still feel fine.  In order to fully take advantage of all the high-tech features and functions of these amazing headphones, they need to be paired with the Sony Headphones Connect app.  For the initial setup, the app requests that pictures of my ears to be taken and sent to Sony's server for improvement analysis.  However, this step is not required in order to use the headphones.  I decided to opt in for supposedly better performance.  These headphones perform impressively right out of the box without needing to adjust the Equalizer.  The sound is crystal clear, and at low bass, no rattling or popping noise detected.  It has Adaptive Sound Control features that can automatically detect whether I'm staying still or moving around while listening to music so that the right amount of noise canceling can be applied.  My favorite feature, and what sets these headphones from the rest, is the 360 Reality Audio.  It takes listening to music to a whole new level and a more immersive experience.  Think of it like 360-degree surround sound.  This is music I can feel.  Unfortunately, only a handful of paid music streaming platforms provide songs with this feature, and the selection is even fewer.  Regardless, this is the future of how music is supposed to be.  However, there are free options available online.  The only thing I find annoyed with this product is that there's no protective case provided.  This makes traveling inconvenient to say the least.  Nonetheless, this has become my go-to headphones, and I would highly recommend it for frugal audiophiles.",5,B0BS74M665,Style Name: WH-CH720N/White,SONY,Headphones,
Alexis H,Good fit - Decent Sound,"These pair easily via bluetooth. I haven't installed the phone app, but they work without it. I found it a little thin in the midsection, but there is good bass. Not sure if the app has EQ adjustments, but if it did that would be helpful. I especially like that it comes with a cord so you can use a hard-wired connection if you need it, like on a desktop without bluetooth, or on a plane.",4,B0BS74M665,Style Name: WH-CH720N/White,SONY,Headphones,
Product TesterProduct Tester,Woah sound quality is awesome!,"First impressions, the sound quality of these is definitely way better than any headphones I currently own in the $40-$60 range, so for the sound the double price of these may make sense for those who need the best sound quality. I'm not sure how these compare to other expensive headphones however.They're very light weight which can be nice, but at the same time the lightweighteness kind of gives them a cheap feeling, making me wonder how long these will actually last.I'll update my review should these not last at least a year.Good headphones so far though!",4,B0BS74M665,Style Name: WH-CH720N/White,SONY,Headphones,
robochick,Need to download app to connect to bluetooth,"My son didn't replace his gaming headset with these since he is very picky about those.  However, he does wear these all the time hooked up to his phone to listen to music, walking around the house, chores, and laying bed.  Some people complaining about the cushion on the ears, but they fit my 12 year old son nicely and holding up fine.  I did put them on and they sound great.  The only thing I didn't like was having to download the app to get the bluetooth to connect but once I did that it was fine.",4,B0BS74M665,Style Name: WH-CH720N/White,SONY,Headphones,
Shopaholic,great sound,"I did receive these headphones through vine but I can say that I am pretty impressed by the sound. it is Sony so I automatically assume better quality. They do have a goos sound to them and decent noise cancelation.I read some other reviews that have complained about the cups flattening out, personally I have not experienced this yet but honestly, I have not been using them for a long time either. I will update this review later if things change for me. Even if the cups failed it would be hard for me to drop a star only for that but I do think at the price point people should not be having that issue. Now with that said, there appears to be what feels like some type of raised object behind the mesh that sticks out some so if the cups failed where those touched your ears then I can definitely see where it would cause discomfort.So far it's a good pair of headphones for me, I am going to let my daughter use them which will really give it the test for my update later.",5,B0BS74M665,Style Name: WH-CH720N/White,SONY,Headphones,
CaOhio 88,New favorite headphones,"I used these as a replacement for an older model (2-3 years old) sony bluetooth noise cancelling headphones. These are better in every way. The older pair was slightly smaller in dimensions, but the new ones with a little bit bigger ear piece manage to be lighter. The headband does not squeeze the head as tightly either. The ear pieces completely cover my ears without being collossal in overall size. The bluetooth has connected immediately to my phones and laptop with no lag. The noise cancelling is better than the prior model. The ambient sound modes are awesome. There is a focus on voice ability that allows voices to come through the noise cancelling which worked surprisingly well.Sound is excellent. Bass is adequate - plenty, but not overly bassed. Sound quality is  just a hair below my Sannheisers which are incredible.  I also used these for gaming. They do a decent job with 3d surround sound, and sound effects and world noises are as high quality as music is. I also used these to voice communicate via the phone and computer and they work perfectly. They pick up my voice without any issue when in the normal position on my head.Overall I think these perform perfect for the $150 asking price.",5,B0BS74M665,Style Name: WH-CH720N/White,SONY,Headphones,
LAURAsim,"Great Headphones, Great Sound, Great Noise Cancellation.","These headphones really do sound great.  Set up was easy.  I installed the app for setup, but my husband just used the pairing feature which can be accessed by pressing the power button for an extended time.These are lightweight and the pad feels good on your ears.  My husband did comment that he could feel the inside surface of the speaker area against his hears when wearing them, but perhaps he has big ears.  Once he moved the connecting brace forward on his head (to the top as opposed to back on the crown) he could no linger feel the inside against his ear.The sound quality is excellent throughout the entire volume range.  The price point is a bit high for my budget, but the sound quality and noise cancelling are great.",5,B0BS1QCFHX,Style Name: WH-CH720N/Black,SONY,Headphones,

Fresh and Felicia,"UNBELIEVABLE carbon fiber sound quality, improved ANC with 2 processors and 8 improved mics","The media could not be loaded.                 �I own Sonys WH-1000 XM4s and the Bose 700s, two of the leading models in the industry. I had AirPods Max for a minute, but I rage-sold them. To me, the Sony and Bose are both awesome headsets. So I was psyched to hear Sony was releasing XM5s. Summers here, and these can get a little hot on hot days outdoors. Its like wearing earmuffs on the beach. But, if you can get past a little sweaty ears, or if you use them indoors or on airplanes, you should be a little excited.The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones feature, what Sony advertises, �industry-leading noise cancellation.� And they aint lyin. With Bluetooth 5.2 and Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, the XM5s have DUAL processors - compared to the lonely single processor of the XM4. These two processors control 8 microphones for crazy accurate noise cancellation. Think - a little computer actually sampling noise from fans, airplane engines, air conditioners, motors, and consistent noise like that  - and creates an identical but perfect opposite wave, so they kinda cancel each other out. And this time, the dual processors are capable of filtering higher frequency sounds, including some voices. Its pretty cool tech. The first time you hear this, its like magic! In my video review, you can see my personal reaction.With the XM5s, noise canceling is automatically optimized based on your wearing conditions and environment. You dont have to do anything. It knows if youre sitting, walking, in an airplane, et cetera.No, noise reduction probably wont completely cancel a very loud angry spouse, or a crying baby. But the over the ear closed design may help dull annoying sounds.A very small cadre of people claim they become nauseous using noise cancelling headphones, and especially the old model XM4s. Ive never experienced this personally, but be aware it could happen. You can disable it if you need to. Some people thought the WH-1000XM4s were too snug. I thought they felt great, but theyve improved the fit with a  new lightweight design with soft-fit leather. This material fits snugly but with less pressure on your ears while still keeping out the external sounds you dont want to hear.There were a few other design changes � the XM5s arent foldable like the XM4s, and theres a redesigned case thats collapsible to save room in your bag when youre wearing your headphones.With up to 30 hours of battery life, youll have enough power to travel halfway to the moon in one of Elon Musks rockets. But, in case you forgot to charge and youre in a hurry, you can get 3 hours' worth of charge after just 3 minutes with an optional AC adapter.And unfortunately, the in-flight plug adapter is not included in the supplied accessories this time. But who uses that anyway? Thats so old school! Fortunately, there still is an aux-in for you old-school holdouts.The touch controls survived, where you can pause/play/skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls. And the speak to chat lives also, where as soon as you start a conversation, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops your music and lets in ambient sound. And wear detection knows when you take them off.But � how do they sound?Sony has popped new, more rigid, 30mm carbon fiber drivers in the XM5s. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced sound, better clarity, and more accurate bass. Thats important if you listen to real music, you know, with actual instruments, like rock, jazz, r and b, country, classical, and music like that. The XM4s have 40mm drivers, which will probably be better for hip-hop. The XM5s will reproduce hip-hop very accurately, meaning the way the studio producer intended you to hear it, but they probably wont have the head-vibrating tinnitus-inducing bass many people want. TBH that's hard to find in any headphone due to physics.The XM5s support LDAC and spatial 3D audio, whatever that is, and they have also upgraded their Sony Music Studios Edge-AI music algorithm, which somehow magically guesses what musical dynamics were lost during compression and tries to replace that, so everything sounds crisp and clean without losing the bass thats necessary in most of todays popular music.I have heard some folks claimed the MX4s sounded �muddy� with some music. I didnt notice that, but Im a producer and Im familiar with equalization. There are about 20 presets including several you can create yourself.And even without the Qualcomm APTX Low Latency chip, both my XM4s and XM5s allowed me to watch a complete movie on Netflix on my 2022 Samsung Frame television, wirelessly, from 10-plus feet away, with ZERO loss in mouth synchronization. Plus, like my XM4s, the XM5s still have dual Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's a pretty cool feature if you use them for your phone, but also want to use them to watch YouTube videos at work on your computer. But, you probably shouldnt tell your boss about that.And the XM5s work with Google Assist, Alexa, and Siri. You can even set up Spotify playback with a few taps. Try that on your Air Pods Max.The big win seems to be a vast improvement in the sound of your voice during phone calls quality. Theyre actually impressive when it comes to calling in louder rooms. Ive made test calls on busy streets and on windy sidewalks, and my call-ee said she couldnt tell I was actually outdoors. Apparently, the four beam-forming microphones and the dual-processor software can recognize your voice and somehow block a lot of background noise. I mean, you can still probably hear tire screeches, gunshots, and car alarms, things youll typically hear in the city. But a lot of the noise is just gone. Like magic!Oh � and theres Speak to Chat. You start speaking, and the XM5s automatically adjust noise cancellation to pick up the voices of other people. No buttons, no fumbling with your phone. Thats a pretty cool feature.So are they worth the upgrade? If you have XM4s and you think your call quality is shaky, then grab some XM5s and sell your sweaty old XM4s on Craigslist. If youre moving from Bose's Noise Canceling 700 or QuietComfort 45s, the new dual processors and 8 microphone array will provide some noticeable improvements, plus the dual Bluetooth sync, so theyre probably worth looking into. If youre done with your Air Pods Max and prefer better compatibility with non-Apple stuff including android phones, PCs, and Sony or Samsung Smart TVs, its a no-brainer.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Truthful ReviewerTruthful Reviewer,Best Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Headphones on the Market - Replacing my AirPods Max,"Ready for the best in class noise cancelling headphones with incredible sound profiles completely customizable? I owned them all. AirPods Max, Sony XM3, XM4, Bose 700. The all new Sony XM5s is the new king of NC headphones.� Much Better Microphone (vs. XM4) � Tested with Zoom/Microsoft Teams business calls and family/personal calls. Performs much better than XM4 previous generation� Long Term Comfort � I can wear them for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort while wearing my glasses. XM4s felt warm/hot after long term use, XM5s have more breathability.� Touch Controls � Works flawlessly between swipes and tap. Feels like an upgrade with better sensitivity compared to previous generation.�Bluetooth & Connectivity � I take them off, music pauses, I put them back on, music resumes. I walk anywhere in my home while leaving my phone on my desk. Clear sound, no distortion whatsoever, signal transmission remains in-tact and stable at any given moment. I have them connected to my iPhone and MacBook Pro, Im able to swap between both devices quickly.�Hard Case & Wire � The case is good quality, headphones fit perfectly with slot for USB C charging cable and audio aux cable, both included no extra charge.�Sony app is full of features. Can customize audio profiles or use presets. The presets are excellent for any genres of music and I often swap depending on my mood. Updates are done through the app. NC and transparency mode can be controlled in the app or by using a button on the headphones. Adaptive sound is nice, it auto detects my environment and changes from NC and transparency. It works in my favor, no complaints. Auto power off is an option, or manually turn them off using the button on the headphones.I purchased 2 pairs of the new Sony XM5s � one for my wife and one for myself. We absolutely love using the latest and greater wireless noise cancelling headphones � I can easily say that both Sony and Apple make the best out there. Because I own all the latest NC headphones, I created a comparison below between the 2 best: Sony XM5 and how they compare with Apples Air Pods Max.Sound Quality: Winner TiedI tested the XM5s using Tidal and Apple Music using both wired and wireless. I found the music quality on the XM5s sound better on specific genres such as Jazz, Bossa Nova, Hip-Hop (90s), Classical Rock, Symphony, and R&B.The APM are ahead when it comes to EDM like House, Drum & Bass, along with Pop and other computerized music.Both headphones are close for most genres, however the biggest difference I noticed between the two was Jazz like genres, with the XM5s being leagues ahead.This is a tie because it depends on the genre you prefer.Audio Enhancements: Winner Air Pods MaxThe XM5s offer 360 Audio Reality which is only accessible to less popular streaming music apps like Tidal, while the APM offer Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio. The audio library for the sound enhancement is also smaller for Sony with limited selections.Comfort: Winner Sony XM5The XM5 can remain on your head for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort given its lightweight feel. When walking around the house, or outdoors, the XM5s remains on your head without moving.The APM on the other hand are heavier and begin causing some discomfort after 1-2 hours. When stationary, theyre fine, but when walking around and tilting your head, they begin to slip off.Features: Winner Sony XM5Sony offers an headphones app accessible from the App Store or Google Play Store which allows you to heavily customize your XM5s, from building a sound profile, selecting audio pre-sets, adjusting noise cancelling, transparency modes and a great deal more.The APM on the other hand, do not have an app of any kind, besides the ability to select audio pre-sets from the music app you subscribe to.Transparency Mode: Winner Air Pods MaxThe transparency mode on the APM is unlike anything else; I can have full conversations that sound natural. The XM5s on the other hand are an upgrade from the XM4s, but it doesnt sound as natural as the APM.Microphone: Winner Air Pods MaxThe microphone on the APM is excellent; Ive hosted hundreds of hours of business meetings and personal phone calls; the microphone is crystal clear and professional.The XM5s on the other hand is an upgrade from the XM4s and noticeable a lot better, but the APM are noticeably better. I tested the XM5s for calls and was satisfied with the results.Noise Cancelling: Winner Sony XM5When wearing the APM for a long period of time, my ears feel like theyre going to explode. When I first purchased the APM on the release date, I could use the noise cancelling option for hours however, after over a year, I can no longer handle noise cancellation beyond 15 minutes it gives me severe ear pain and I must switch to transparency mode or take them off and break.The XM5s on the other hand, do not cause me any pain, regardless of if Im listening for 30 minutes or 2 hours. During testing, I listened to music for a long period of time and watched a YouTube for an hour.I feel that prolonged listening to the APM using the noise cancelling feature caused my ears to become highly sensitive after using them for over a year, with a feeling of severe cabin pressure. This is also worse if using the Bose QC35s, with pressure being too intense.I can wear the XM5s for long periods of time; they manage to block loud televisions and screaming babies. The biggest takeaway is being able to keep them on for several hours without discomfort or pain.Build Quality: Winner Air Pods MaxThe APM are built to look and feel luxurious. From the band, metal, and aluminum components, they feel like the Lamborghini of headphones. The XM5s on the other hand are made out of sophisticated plastic. Also, the APM has magnetic interchangeable ear cushions that can be purchased separately, while the XM5s do not.Accessories & Costs: Winner Sony XM5Sony offers a real carrying case that protects the headphones and its accessories from damage/drops. Apple has a bra-like case that doesnt protect the headphones at all, forcing the user to purchase a third-party case online. Also, Sony offers a headphone cable, while Apple requires a separate purchase ($45). This means between the cable and the case; youre looking at almost $100 of added expenses with the APM.Moreover, the price at the time of this review is $499 for the XM5s and $779.00 for the APM. The Sonys offer a much better value.Conclusion:There are many factors to take into consideration between both brands, but ultimately, my heart is with the XM5s because they sound better for the genres I listen to (Jazz) on a daily basis, and it puts me in the musical �zone. Also, the noise cancelling feature from the XM5s dont give me the �cabin pressure feeling found from the APM. The price difference between both is also substantial given they are close in most categories.",5,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,
Realistic Reviewer,Unbelievably Quiet! Exceeds Expectations,"I owned the WH-1000XM3 & they were the best ANC headphones I'd ever encountered, until the WH-1000XM4 came out & yes I did upgrade. The WH-1000XM4 was a big improvement over the already extremely hot WH-1000XM3. Needless to say I wondered if Sony would make a WH-1000XM5, because how do you improve on perfection??? Well I pre-ordered these from Amazon & I got the this afternoon. Sony not only improved perfection, they redefined it!The WH-1000XM5 are incredible! The previous WH-1000XM4 had 1 Sony QN1 ANC processor with 4 microphones & it did an amazing job at noise cancellation! It even had a handy button on the headphones themselves that once pressed would start an automated ANC optimization algorithm.  Well, these new WH-1000XM5 not only have an updated version of Sony's QN1 ANC processor, it has 2 of them! Where the WH-1000XM4 had 4 microphones, the WH-1000XM5 has 8 microphones. Each updated Sony QN1 ANC processor has 4 microphones attached to it. Not only is that a dramatic improvement, you no longer have to start the ANC Optimization, as the WH-1000XM5 constantly monitors your environment & adjust the ANC to automatically block out nearly all noise!!! Further more it actually works extremely well! The WH-1000XM5 are nearly completely silent! They also support LDAC via Bluetooth with ANC  & they sound phenomenal!Now I actually did buy all of these myself, trust me I wish Sony would let me test and/or review these things! But I have actually owned the WH-1000XM3, WH-1000XM4 & WH-1000XM5 & the WH-1000XM5 is absolutely the best of the best!",5,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,
Onur Baykal,An Incredible Upgrade Even Coming From the WH-1000XM4s,"The design changes, overall comfort (including level of head pressure) and potability have all been significantly improved. I actually disagree with many of the editors reviews, it's much better that it doesn't fold twice, the case is much thinner to transport. This also helps make the headphones much more durable overall.In terms of the previous generation model, put quite simply, sound quality is more in line with a neutral profile sounding acoustically tuned pair of reference headphones. Noise cancelling and transparency modes are a night and day difference with respect to the 1000XM4s, but both are still excellent pairs of headphones. The improvements here are well justified for an upgrade. Also the sound profile of the previous generation WH-1000XM4s can be easily restored by using the ""excited"" EQ setting in the companion app settings.Those carbon fiber dual drivers, 8 noise canceling mics and custom audio co-processor Sony keeps referring to in the marketing materials, are genuinely significant. If you're coming from the previous generation model, the differences are immediately noticable.The price has increased but considering there's a chip shortage and they improved literally all the right aspects of this new pair. It's justified.Well done Sony. And for all those purchasing, enjoy them, they're industry leading for a reason.",5,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,
kcdkcd,"Not bad, but I expected a little better if I'm honest.","I'm a hobbyist musician and sound engineer of 20 years and also mild audiophile that builds my own speakers. I like to think I know a little bit about sound and what it takes to reproduce sound, but the tricky thing with headphones is that everybody's' ears are different. Like, they're physically slightly different which makes every single person hear the exact same sound slightly different, but there's also our individual listening preferences too, so keep that in mind as you read this review. Personally, I prefer smooth, balanced, and LOW bass (down to 20Hz), but NOT boomy bass. I also like some sparkle in the highs (8k+).Initial impressions upon arrival and setup:- The packaging looks like it's a cheap recycled cardboard of some sort. Obviously doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- The zipable case the headphones live in also seem kinda cheap and flimsy. Again, it doesn't affect the headphone's performance.- Accessories are fairly light as it only comes with a stubby little 8"" long (seriously) USB charging cable (not even a wall adapter, just USB A to USB C) and a generic 1/8"" stereo headphone cable if you want to physically plug them into a headphone jack.- The app was easy to download, install, and update. It did require making a Sony account though, so points off for that.- Pairing the headphones to my phone and also my computer was quick and seamless. I did have to restart my computer to get Windows to send audio over the bluetooth connection, but that was an issue with Windows and not the headphones.- The headphones themselves feel of good quality and are super comfy for my average sized head.- The EQ you set in the app does persist when you connect to a different sound source. For example, the EQ curve I set on my phone was not active when I then paired the headphones to my laptop and listened to the same track.- Really needs more than 6 EQ points. Sony, you can do better than just 5 predefined sliders and a bass slider (basically 6 sliders, so IDK why the bass is separate from the rest).Listening impressions:- Best sounding headset I've purchased to date and sound MILES better than my Sennheiser HD 596 (but to be fair, those sounded ridiculously unnatural and just all-around terrible).- Plenty of ""thump"" by default, but definitely dropping off significantly below 50Hz or so, which is exactly what I like to have present in my mix. You can see I've put a HUGE boost in the low lows on my EQ curve to make things like low synths, bass drops, and sub-harmonics sound even with the rest of the sound stage. Even still, the sub-bass that is there still sounds a bit thin and artificial like they're using some processing trickery to make it sound like it's playing lower than it is (there are a few ways to do this, but they're never as authentic as just reproducing the frequency properly).- Little bit ""dark"" sounding, so a slight bump in the high mids as well as a 10k+ shelf bump really helped brighten up the sound stage.- Imaging is ok but definitely not spectacular. It's only got a single 30mm driver per ear, so that one driver is covering EVERYTHING from 20Hz to 40kHz. As such, it's expected that imaging won't be super detailed, so no surprise there. I was really hoping to see at least 2 drivers per ear. By contrast, my CCA C12 in-ear-monitors (IEM's) that I use when playing on stage are about $50 and have 6 drivers PER EAR each playing a different frequency range. Needless to say, the imaging, and extension on those IEM's is a LOT better than these headphones that cost 7x the price. Due to their small form factor, IEM's can use armature drivers where 'can' style headphones like this can't use armature drivers (not loud enough), but I would still like to see 2 dynamic drivers in these just to allow one driver to focus on the highs and the other to focus on the lows rather than having the one driver trying to play the whole shebang.- Minimal, but still present, ""pressure"" sensation when noise cancelling is on, but it's not intrusive like a lot of other ANC headphones I've tried and effectively disappears when music is playing. Having a set of ANC headphones with ""pressure"" that grabs my attention is an absolute deal-breaker for me regardless of price point.Overall, these are going to be my go-to headphone for the office. They sound good enough (especially with some EQ), and are comfy enough, to have some background music playing for hours at a time while also cancelling out loud office talkers.",4,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
MahajoMahajo,Sonys Best Noise Cancelling Headphones Yet!,"No Doubt these are excellent headphones. Sony has taken an already established series and made them better. Some may not like that they dont fold down but the case is slim and it should mean better durability in the long run so I have no issues with it at all as far as that goes. My only real complaints are that the wear sensor rarely works, really 1 out of 10 times will the headphones pause when I remove themI dont know if it is because of the sensor being set inside the fabric vs. outside like the M4s, or something else. May be just my unit I suppose. I dont absolutely need it to work especially since the touch controls work really well so I can live with that. The only other issue is for comfort. Dont get me wrong, overall they are super light and comfortable but the light padding on the headband does cause some discomfort after awhile. A little adjustment and it is better but could be an issue for some. I also wish that Sony could do something to make the headphones power on and connect more quickly. If you have them connected to two devices it takes about 10 seconds to connect to both. However the connection is strong and I have no issues with that! And the multi point function works flawlessly!Noise Cancelling is no doubt the reason to buy these headphones and it is best in class, but as with all noise cancelling headphones there are limitations. It blocks a lot of noise, no doubt, but if the song playing is quiet or the quiet spots between tracks then noise can get through in those moments. It does not block 100% of noise, but it is probably the best Ive ever tested.Battery life is as expected, but if you like it loud with max noise canceling as well as the DSEE Extreme and Equalizer enabled the battery life definitely takes a hit, but is still good.Sound quality is really good. It is not as good as some of my other headphones from Bang and Olufsen, Sennheiser or arguably even the AirPods Max, but is up there. For overall features and noise cancelling these cannot be beat! Another great thing is the speak to chat. It works really well but I keep it off most of the time because itll be triggered too easily with a cough or a hum but the great thing is you can toggle the feature on or off by pressing two fingers to the touch pad. Game changer! So if Im entering a store, for example, I can toggle it on when I enter and then toggle it back off on the way out! That is so awesome to me! Makes the feature so much more sensible for me.One last note is on the color: I chose the �platinum silver� because I read the black was a finger-print magnet and I wanted to avoid that. This color is okay but kind of blah. But although the headphones are made of recycled materials it still has a slightly more premium build quality than some but is nowhere the build quality of some others like the Bang & Olufsen Beoplay H95s. But they are unbelievably light weight so that is a good reason to go with those materials. I also love the simple packaging they come in with no plastic and no waste. Its a nice eco-friendly way to go and I applaud them for that! Overall, these are first-rate headphones and I would highly recommend them (even over the M4s as I like the new design and the sound quality, to my ears at least, is improved over the old model).Update: September 27, 2022. I had to downgrade these to 4 stars because of the wear sensor. Overall they are great, but the wear sensor not working is really bugging me because I feel it should work, after all the XM4s had a wear sensor that worked much more reliably and since this is the follow up it should work at least as well, if not better. Curious if anyone else has this issue or if its just my unit. Also on several occasions the touch control has become completely non responsive and Ive had to power them off and on again to get it to work again. A little frustrating (especially when you look like an idiot banging repeatedly on the ear cup trying to get it respond).",4,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,
Richard HuynhRichard Huynh,Sony never disappoints!,"I thoroughly enjoy what Sony has to offer in their product line. I have the PlayStation 5, a Sony Bravia 4K TV and several other Sony products. Yes although I have owned a few of their product line I will not try to be biased here with the review. What got me into Sony products was really their earphones dating back to 2011! They have the best earphones you could get for $20 back at the time in 2011 and now the quality they still continue to put out never disappoints! Here's the pros and cons of the Sony WH-1000XM5.Update: I also picked up the XM4 Earbuds from Sony and take note that those are on a different level for listening to music compared to the XM5 Over the Ear headphones. Shares the same features like the XM5, not the same sound like over the ear obviously but also more marketed to those who goes to the gym and likes something more compact.Pros:Comfortable and lightweight!I don't ever have a complaint with what they have to offer when it comes to comfort. These are better than BOSE in regards as to comfort. I think the one thing that makes them comfortable also is that they are light. They weigh only about 0.56 pounds! People tend to have problems with headphones if they are heavy in my opinion! I also assume they use a low density memory foam for cushioning which is great but will eventually need to be replaced or tended to if left compressed or squished for too long.Unique featuresNoise Cancelling is top notch but not much different than their previous lines in my opinion! It is a standard these days to get noise cancelling and the headphones are great for drowning out noise if need be. They also tend to those who need to be aware of their surroundings by implementing a ambient mode like previous models. Works great and works like a charm by either taking the headphones off or covering the touch control panel. Also the Speak to Pause Music feature is insanely nice to have! Helps when your hands are busy and or you just don't want to adjust your headphones having to speak.Superb sound!The sound quality out of these are amazing! Does really well in all areas of music genres. Particularly really in low frequencies for bass! I get to enjoy these at a great volume and it pairs amazingly with my PS5 as a gaming headset! (Will mention the headphones does not come with a microphone for gaming when using a headphone jack.) As a pair of noise cancelling headphones, you can expect to hear a positively good detail in music, movies, gaming or even a phone call! They are clear and surprisingly really balanced. The microphone on these headphones for phone calls are great. Better than the previous versions.Fast charging!The charging rate of these headphones is incredible! I never knew how fast charging can be with this! There's times I have left this powered on overnight as I'm at work for my 10 hour job and it was drained by the time I wanted to use it again. In those times I left it charging and goodness greatness these were ready to go in a about 10-15 minutes!  I enjoy these so much that I'm actually glad they have a 24-30 hour battery life.Cons:Cost.Its expensive! If you can get these on sale, it's worthwhile! If it's in your budget go for it! You pay for what you get in my opinion and these are worth their weight in gold!Fitment.They don't exactly fit around my short wide neck whenever I need to take it off and be present in a conversation or in my surroundings. Not exactly a big matter or deal breaker. More so it's a personal perspective. My neck size is 15 � inches in circumference and that's pretty average I believe. I have to extend these in order to keep them around my neck without compromise. They also do not fold inward like the previous Sony headphone models but again never a issue.Cushion. Yes the ear cup cushions are comfortable but again when I place them around my neck it compresses the cushion to a point where it feels awkward after putting it back on. I'm looking at other options to replace their soft fit leather design.Update: There is different earcups that you can replace the OEM cups with but it comes at a cost of I believe $60 which is worth noting.Conclusion.Worthiness of $350+ (price as of 12/07/2022) during the holidays? Yes!Personal opinionated review:Sony WH-1000XM5 or other leading competition? Sony, easily Sony. I've never been unhappy about this purchase and I tell people that Sony is industrial leading company that continues to impress people when it comes to their headphones. Beats by Dre(Apple), Apple and Bose has always been great by popularity but Sony gets appraised by quality!I will update this review as I go until they put a new model out.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
BunnyBunny,"Disappointing, painful *Edit*","Edit after 5 months of use:Disconnects are more frequent, and at times it would suddenly lower the audio quality. The only way to fix it is to stop everything you're doing, turn it off, turn it on, and hope it reconnects. If I could, I'd get a refund. Either I have a defective model or it happens to everyone just not as frequent.**Edit after a month of use:Using Multi-device connection is very spotty, 3 out of 10 times the headphones will completely turn off without warning, even with a full battery. Noise cancelling is still very annoying, I'll hear all the sound around me till it decides to kick in and block some of it. With no way to adjust the amount of Noise Cancellation happening, the M3's I've been using has better blocking on some occasions. The issue with the band on the top is still just as bad, it genuinely hurts after long amounts of use. The only improvement from the M3 that I see is I can KIND OF sleep on my side with these on and they stay on my head better without sliding down.I still do no recommend this unless you plan on wearing it for short periods and in a quiet environment.**So this review is coming from someone who's worn the M3 Headset for over 4 years and I have to say, it's awful.I live in a place where there's sound in every direction. Dogs barking, kids screaming, everything you can think of, and ANC is a requirement for getting any work done.So the good:- Ear cups are comfortable, doesn't crush your head after long periods of time.- Sound is good, not absolutely amazing, but good. You need to download the Sony app to alter the sound to allow any bass to work, otherwise it'll sound static-y.- ANC is awesome but it's adaptive, which I don't like, but can be a plus for some. When it worked it blocked out almost every single sound.- The case design is cool, it has a little compartment inside that holds the charger cable and headphone jack.The bad:- I'm used to my M3's cancelling noise constantly, this device would adapt to the sound around you, letting sound bleed through before blocking it out after. Example: I was listening to a song at moderate volume, I could make any sound I want and I couldn't hear it. When the music had a break in volume, I could hear a LOT outside the headphones.- The head band that goes over your head is PAINFUL! It legit hurt after only an hour of use, it has almost NO padding and it was a thin plastic.- THE COLLAPSABLE CASE IS TERRIBLE! I unzipped the case to take the headphones out, I used them for a good 2 hours, put them back into the case, and when I went to open it again the zipper got stuck and it's IMPOSSIBLE to open now. Trust me, I got three separate people to try and open the case, they can't.I've been looking forward to a new ANC headphone brand, and I'm disappointed Sony didn't have someone wear these for more than an hour or try zipping and unzipping the bag more than a few times before going ""yep, let's send them out."".Sadly, I do no recommend these unless they are on sale and you DIY a comfortable way of wearing them for the top of your head. If they update the ANC and you want to work on making it not hurt the top of your head, they are decent, but not 400$ plus tax decent.The red circle on the picture shows a hole in the zipper, making it impossible to fully open.",2,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
AmitabhAmitabh,Read this only if you are an iPhone user!!,"I have used this product for around 6hrs with my iPhone (+apple music). A lot of reviews and videos are already out there on social media for its features, will not comment on those things.�Sound quality out of the box (EQ) isnt something wow on apple music or spotify premium!!�The EQ customisation comes to rescue and improves sound staging drastically, m using a Custom EQ which I have attached in my review, it gives better sound staging. (For those like airpods pro user or who are finding bass too muffled can try this EQ, hope that will help)�Silver colour isnt attracting visible smudges as much as the black ones.�Connectivity and touch functions are butter smooth.�Call clarity with zooms or Microsoft teams is just amazing.�Siri responses to input commands by long pressing right earcup. (However doesnt automatically reads notifications or caller names like in airpods pro/Max)�USB charging cable is too small.Will not recommend to upgrade if you are already using Apple music with Airpods pro/Max as the spatial audio is best utilised there. Spotify or other users can go ahead, also if you can use this for your official WFH meetings then its a must buy.Will update if I find something more helpful.",4,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,
Bast,"Smaller heads, folks with hair, and sensitive temples..read this","First off, I havent had a chance to test all functionality yet. I am coming here in hopes of helping someone else out with their frustration.If you're nervous about dropping the money, do it. The app (if you let it) will track your usage. Get them, set an alert for a day or two before the return period is up. Try them out and then check your usage when the alarm goes off. If you need/use headphones I almost guarantee youre going to find these worth it.RE: Small headsYour head might not be too small. I realized after two days of use I was fitting them more like traditional headphones and they were siting on one or two lobes very slightly.When you fit, and while you get used to putting them on, I suggest:- lengthening the headand (as app suggests)- 'scooping' your ears lobes up and inside the pads rather than under them at all- then gently fitting headbandOnce I started doing this my fit issues nearly dissappeared(hair..). Biggest issue now is the band material is not grippy at all and I have very smooth/slick hair, so it wiggles a bit. If I troubleshoot around this I will update.Of note and Re:Sensitive TemplesThese do not need to be as secure over all (other than having the suction over the ears) as you will not want these to get wet, period. These are not designed for exercise or heavy movement. They are sufficiently set for walking around or hanging out, this protects you from losing suction without significant pressure on your temples and keeps these super light headphones EXTREMELY comfortable. Which for someone like me that gets migraines with nearly ANY temple pressure has been... life changing.The suction aspect for proper noise cancelation is fairly fundamental. It's an even bigger deal with these as they'll adjust sound and I could see if suction was lost at an inopportune moment it could be...uncomfortable.RE: HairY'all, your hair is going to need to be out of the way. I have already noticed that one or two small strands will absolutely affect the seal. I won't notice it immediately but when I move around or talk I'll notice a sound change (almost like a varying level of wubba womp like entering a tunnel or in elevation changes) and at the corresponding ear I'll find hair between my ear and headphones. If you experience this in one or both ears...check for anything preventing a seal! It's annoying to navigate but as with adjusting the fit as above the more I do it, the easier it is to do upfront/as second nature.The app is fairly easy to navigate but has a small learning curve, nothing atronimical. The only other app ive used for headphones was Jabra about 2 years ago. Theyve likely updated since but compared to the 2020 Jabra app..this app is night and day better in terms of navigation and ease of use.So far my only con has been switching between my TV and my phone. This could be me, I think this may just be a learning curve I havent yet had time to solve. What it was doing: Paired to both. Switched to phone to do some Duolingo. For some reason any adjustment i made unpaused my TV and swapped where the sound was coming from. When I re-paused my TV I'd have to reselect my phone..and then it would do this again. So for now Im just leaving the TV unpaired. I mostly dont need this anyway but thought it might be nice for my neighbors late at night.Summation without even talking about its sound quality, noise cancelation and other functions (which are amazing):These headphones are worth the price tag for the lack of weight on my temples ALONE. Everything else is  icing on the cake.If something changes I will absolutely return here to update.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
mhans311,Comparison to Bose NC700,"I have used Bose NC700 for the past year, but saw these on sale for a great price and decided to try them. I had the XM4s for a short time but had to return them because they were too creaky while wearing them. Luckily I have not had that same issue so far with the XM5s. My biggest priorities for headphones is comfort, sound quality (both for music and phone calls), and noise cancellation.ComfortThe XM5s have ear cups that are slightly larger than the XM4s and they also look slightly larger than the NC700s. This helps them go over the ears better. However, the NC700s have slightly thicker padding which makes the inside of the cup a little deeper. For this reason, I would say that the NC700s are a bit more comfortable for long periods. The XM5s are very comfortable, but after a couple of hours, I definitely start to feel them more than the NC700s. But both are great.Sound QualityThis is a matter of preference, but I prefer the deeper bass and fuller sound of the XM5s. I would say the NC700s have a more balanced sound, with far less low end. The XM5s really give a nice full bass, without it being over-bearing. I do prefer a bit more lower end than what the Bose provides. So for me, I prefer the sound quality of the XM5s quite a bit more than the NC700s.Call QualityI use my headphones for work calls several hours a day. Both the XM5 and the NC700 have great call quality and will work really well if you use them for phone calls or Zoom meetings a lot. I think Id give the edge to the XM5s because they block out ambient noise slightly better than the NC700s, but the difference is negligible.Noise CancellationI mean, these are high end headphones and both do a great job with noise cancellation. I will say, I was surprised at how much noise the XM5s can block out. They block out voices and medium pitched noises better than the NC700s. They are both great with lower pitched things like plane noise. But I think the XM5s do a better job overall.Build Quality and DesignThis is where the Bose NC700s are just better than the XM5s. The build of the NC700s is just beautiful. They feel substantial without being too heavy, and there isnt a seam anywhere. I also think they just look amazing. The XM5s do have seams around the ear cups and they feel much more plasticky. The XM5s are not bad, but they just are not as good as the NC700s as far as design and build quality.Battery LifeThe battery on the NC700 lasts me around 13 or 14 hours. The XM5s last around 25 hours. So its a pretty big difference. Charging speed seems about the same with both.Odds and EndsFeatures of each are similar. They both offer pass through audio and it works well on both. Touch controls work equally well on both. The case of the XM5s is a little bigger than the NC700s, if that matters to you. One small difference that may make a difference to some is that if you want to use the cord to plug them into a 3.5mm headphone jack, the end the plugs into the NC700s is 2.5mm. So if you lose the included cord, you will need a specific type of aux cord to replace it (2.5mm to 3.5mm). Whereas the XM5 uses a regular 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux cord.Overall I do like these Sonys better. I just wish they had the comfort and build quality of the Bose. But because of the superior noise cancellation and sound quality, Im going to be using the Sonys from now on.",4,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,
Natalie M,I hate these. Total downgrade from the XM4s in terms of comfort.,"I had the XM4s and returned them when I heard that the XM5s were being released, and I must say that I am deeply regretting it. I can't speak to the noise cancelling or the sound because the discomfort of these headphones overshadows all of that. Hate is a strong word but I am incredibly diappointed in these. I have a small head and most headphones hurt me due to to the clamp of the U shape, and the XM4s seemed to have a less pronounced curve so I could wear them comfortably for hours. After 5 minutes of the XM5s, they have to come off. The strong U-shape of the XM5s also makes it so that the cups don't sit flush to my ears, so I can feel the bottom of the earcup press into my head much more than the top. Also, the band at the top is so thin and round that it places extra pressure on the top of my head. At least on the XM4s, the band was wide so it helped distribute that pressure in a way that made the headphones feel weightless.Another thing that I miss about the XM4s is that there was a clear diagram in the case showing where the controls were. I can't for the life of me figure out where that information is for the XM5s! It's not in the app, the tiny ""reference guide"" booklet, nor even on the internet.Most reviews have already mentioned this but another gripe I have is that the XM5s don't fold and therefore the case is huge. As a person who travels frequently for work, this is a huge no-no for me. Seriously, what was Sony thinking?Overall, these headphones are a huge letdown. Sony tried to follow the Apple trend and prioritize looks over function, and that's a real shame.",1,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
James B.,"Horrible, and worse with update","I think the sound quality is great for music, as long as you do not touch the equalizer.  If you try to boost the bass or try any of the presets, the sound is just wrong.  Its not like adjusting the equalizer on an amp on your car stereo or something.  The equalizer makes things sound distorted. I have a pair of headphones that I bought for $25 two years ago.  Comparing them with these $400 headphones, the Sony headphones are marginally better in sound, not phenomenally, amazingly better, just a slight improvement.The supposedly automated functions are not automatic.  When I answer a call, many times I have to select that the audio goes to my headphones, so the person calling just gets silence until I can switch it over manually.  Not a big deal if these headphones cost $30, but at $400, when they brag about doing everything so smoothly, that is a big deal.  The headphones do not switch automatically from my iPhone to my iPad. I have to go into settings, unpair the headphones from one device, then go into the settings on the other device and pair them.  Again, I can do this, but it is very annoying that the headphones dont do it automatically.  When I was out walking and set the headphones for more transparency, because I walk on a neighborhood street with some light traffic, the headphones repeatedly turned on noise cancellation when I didnt ask for that.  Not only is that annoying, it is potentially dangerous if I cant hear an electric car sneaking up on me.After a few days of use, new problems are arising.  The app just completely stopped working, so I had to delete it and download it again.  It will still say the headphones dont exist while I am listening to them.  The headphones will shut themselves off for no reason.As far as cancellation of background noise when you are making calls or voice memos, yes, it does remove background noise.  However, my voice sounds very synthesized and unnatural.  I find my voice very unpleasantly unnatural when listening to voice memos Ive made.Battery life seems very good.  I believe their stated hours of use is probably right and certainly sufficient.I would not say they are so comfortable that I could wear them all day.  They are comfortable enough, but I definitely feel them.  I have had other headphones that I completely forgot I had them on because they were light and soft.  These headphones dont give me a headache, but I wouldnt go so far as to say they are the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, which they ought to be at that price. Also, they get hot after a while.  You certainly wouldnt want to wear them on a hot day.  You cant use them outside on a rainy day or on a hot day.  You can only use them outdoors on certain sunny, breezy, cool days, so basically they are useless outdoors for most of the year.A relatively minor issue, but I dont like the smell of them.  They smell like plastic even after a couple of days.I will probably return them if a software update doesnt fix a lot of the problems.  I dont have an extra $400 to waste on a toy.  I bought these headphones believing they would work as advertised and that I would be able to work better in noisy environments and be more productive.  So far, that has definitely not been the case.The software updated.  It took forever.  Now the headphones are worse.  New problem, if Im listening to the headphones on my iPhone, and also using my iPad, every time a search box appears on my iPad screen, the headphones, synced to my iPhone, shut off.  How is that even possible.  I couldnt even dream up the ways these headphones fail.",1,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
LyricSpring77LyricSpring77,"Best ANC - that Sounds great, Comfortable and Great Connectivity","This probably is my first product that I pre-ordered. I generally wait, do extensive research and try it myself before spending such a huge amount on any product. Sony has built a very strong brand for itself in the wireless headphone space since the launch of XM series. XM 3-4 both are great products, with no major issues. But they both had 1 or 2 drawbacks that didn't push be enough to upgrade and buy one.XM4 Bass is little forward for me. I like to prefer tighter, clear bass. XM5 delivers that.XM5 - the good Stuff1) ANC - Best ANC in the market. I own several Bose headphones and earbuds. This has far the best ANC.12 Quick setup- It took me not more than 5 mins to open the box, connect my phone and start listening. Battery was pre-charged to about 65%3) Comfortable - The earcup are soft padded with a faux leather type material that appears to be of good quality. Will have to see how it performs during sweaty, hot environment.4) Connectivity- It connect seamless, and quickly. The range is insane. I can literally walk all around in my home or in my backyard away from my phone and it stay connected. I have had no issue of any drop at all.5) Battery/Charging - Long enough and charges quickly6) App features/Options - Multiple options to customize EQ setting, noise cancellation, transparency etc.7) Multiple device connectivity8) Love the Sand (white) color9) Sound Quality - Last but not the least sound quality is amazing. The default EQ out of the box is really good. But if you customize the EQ and bump little bit the Clear bass and treble it just sounds amazing.It's been 6 hours non-stop listening for me, I have played all kind of genre and they all sound great.XM5-Not so good1) Carrying Case - Case is little big, flatter. The headphone doesn't fold. Not a huge deal, but it could be issue for some.2) It can get hot after couple of hours.To sum it up, for 4hunderd bucks, it is not a cheap headphone. But does it deserve the price tag and delivers on that. YES! With all the features it has, I really do not find anything that I am going to be missing or need for at least several years. It even has a 3.5mm jack :)This will be my new travelling buddy as I prepare to start travelling again!",5,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,

I've had the WH-1000XM3 headphones for a few years, and they're great - but comparing them to the XM5 now they sound muffled and closed-in!A massive difference is with the quality of the voice pickup, for calls and videos. The WH-1000XM3 were adequate at best, but I used other headphones for work calls. The XM5s? Crystal clear. I mean night-and-day compared to the older cans, and better even than the expensive work-focused headphones provided by my office. I've attached a video with a recording made using these WH-1000XM5 headphones to give you an idea.Finally, they are very, very comfortable to wear. Most comfortable headphones I've had by a margin.Bottom line? Get them. They are worth every cent.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
kbs,Audiophiles take note,"First, if I were reading the following review I wouldnt believe it so Ill understand if you dont. Ive been a lifelong audiophile (meaning its my hobby) for about 40 years. Like everyone else, ive been into high-end headphones and high-rez audio for the last decade or so. I bought these because I had a gift card to spend and I wanted to get a full-size set of cans wit great noise cancelling (better than my airpod pros). Wasnt really interested in audio - after all, I have a collection of high-end cans, IEMs and CIEM;s to pick from. This includes Sennheiser HD-650, B&W P7, Phillips Fidelio X2. For IEMs Shure SE535 & Westone UM50SE, for CIEM JH Audio J13 v2. All fed high-rez files through a JDS El Dac & Schiit Asgard II. So not super high end, but definitely not mid-Fi either. All of the above COMPLETELY, utterly blow away my AirPod pros and a pair of Sony Bluetooth extra bass cans (the 900s) that I got just to indulge my bass-head moods. What I most certainly didnt even remotely expect was that I would actually like the WH-1000XM5s for music (considering what I already have). Surprise, surprise. These are AWESOME!!! Fed with the same high-rez files I use for my high-end system (which of course dont get to the drivers  as high-rez because its just crappy Bluetooth), I am shocked to say that I actually like this BETTER!!! Maybe Ive just lost my mind, but yes, I actually prefer these to anything else I have. Any audiophile knows the experience of when you get something that noticeably steps up your sound, you cant help but go through your whole music collection to re-listen to everything because now its better. Thats exactly what Ive been doing since these showed up. I am dumbfounded. I don;t know what it is -  maybe its the crafty AI they are using in the DDSSE (or whatever they call it), but this is the most open, detailed, liquid, textured, etc. sound I have. And thats just streaming Apple Music HD and Amazon Music HD through an iPhone! No amp. No DAC.  No fancy silver cables. By far the bass Ive EVER heard in a headphone - deep, powerful and exquisitely detailed. Again, maybe Ive just lost my mind, but Sony, all I can say is WOW!!!",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Rebecca,"Not worth the money, don't understand the good reviews","I was fairly disappointed with a few things. The noise cancelling is great for frequencies like those of a fan or jet engine. Absolutely dulls the sounds down and I actually fell asleep with how quiet my surroundings were. For voices? Not the same. Can definitely still hear what everyone is saying and it only dulls them down the slightest bit. Now my main reason for buying these was because I'm going on a plane next week and needed something that was noise cancelling as i have sensory issues but was also looking for a new daily over ear headphone. I'm sure these will have no issues to remove plane jet noise etc. Additionally, the microphones on these are fantastic and people on the other end didn't even know I was wearing the headphones due to how clear they were.Very disappointed with everything else. The sound quality is absolutely horrible compared to other headphones I've listened to. There is ZERO bass even after messing with equalizer settings and turning the bass to ""10+"" it was very flat and neutral. The volume also doesn't get high enough in my opinion; also the higher you turn the volume the less ""full"" sounding the music is if listening to songs, especially if you have custom settings on the equalizer (makes it sound cheap). Never had that issue with others. Coming from Skullcandy crusher evos, i obviously understand these are geared towards being a noise cancelling headphone and not a bass headphone, however I expected more for $500 of my own money.Additionally, these headphones don't fold and come in a larger case than 90% of other headphones out there. Seriously Sony who thought of the no folding design?While they're very light and comfy, have great noise cancelling for certain frequencies, contain amazing call quality, have 30-40 hrs of battery and the touch sensors on the right ear cup are SUPER fun and easy to use, I would not buy these if you're also expecting great sound. Definitely not for people looking for normal to decent bass at the very least.I will say if you're someone who listens to non-bassy music then the audio can actually be super good. But it definitely still doesn't get loud enough. It's also made out of that weird plasticy material that shows fingerprints VERY easily and makes it look like it's dirty. Blah. Will be looking into boses or an alternative instead after my flight",3,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
JP,Dissapointed,"Compared to my XM3 and XM4s I dont notice a huge improvement in noise canceling. Sound quality is certainly different, but I wouldnt go as far as to say its better. Highs and mids feel improved, but the low end feels so flat now.Importantly, the headphones feel EXTREMELY cheap. Also the cushioning on the headband is significantly reduced, so it behinds to dig into the top of my head after about an hour. Ear cups feel great, but the headband is a huge step backwards.",2,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Joshua,Practically exactly what I wanted,"The noise cancelation is really good. Like really good. But there are a couple complaints. They won't always block the same amount of noise, so if you live in a semi noisy environment, that really changes the way you look at these headphones. You can hear when the quality of this feature specifically, drops or rises. A really simple fix though, just turn the volume up a little more. Then it really is just you and the music. The transparency mode I felt just slightly let down. It can be better. Speak to chat is much more powerful which upsets me because it's like you don't even have headphones on. You end up wanting that kind of immersion on demand when it's only attainable through the speak/hold to chat features. Of course when those are enabled, the volume of your music gets reduced HEAVILY, so you can hear what's going on. If you're just turning on ambient noise, you might find it muddy or just not as clear as you'd expect or want. An amazing feature with ambient noise though,  is you can control how much noise comes through. This helps me a lot because if you are feeling overwhelmed by your environment, you can just turn it down or shut it off completely. I guess you can say you have a lot of choices between complete isolation, and near perfect immersion. The pros, in my opinion, really overpower the cons. The sound quality is amazing. You can expect crisp, clear, quality audio with insane customization. The separation and sound staging are quite precise I'd say, and with the app you can have practically unlimited bass while still maintaining crisp, prominent highs, that do not interrupt or drown out the mids. Of course the amount of depth these headphones have can only make you dream of what more they may be capable of. I absolutely love the equalizer because now you have such a range with your listening experience, you can resonate with music on so many different levels using the equalizer. These headphones are built for every genre of music BECAUSE they're so precise and customizable as far as sound goes. That's a massive plus, interpreting a song differently because you changed the way it sounded. The smaller drivers do not in any way take from the sound quality. They sound like quality headphones, and the volume control is consistent. The sound quality does not change until about maybe 90-100%. They fit nice, but I wish the design were more like travel headphones where you fold the cups into themselves. They feel very durable, especially the headband. The touch sensors are nice too, but I wish you could use both cups instead of one, so you can customize what taps do what. Overall, they were worth the money. They're for everyone, however you listen, and whatever you listen to. Your preference in sound can be a lot more precise using these headphones. I mean, they really make it hard to say another pair is better. I have grown a lot with these headphones, musically speaking. There are no boundaries in the world of music, and there certainly are not limitations to reach that boundless world inside these headphones.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
ImranImran,Industry leading ?,"Hello Fellow buyer's!!Many of you must have ended up being interested in this product after watching many reviews on the YouTube already, afterall below 25-30K isnts a small amount of money for a pair of Headphones right? So I will sum my experience about this pair in three major areas Comfort, ANC and Call quality and Sound quality.1. Comfort:These are very lightweight, people complain them for feeling cheap and plasticky thats obvious you dont get lightweight with metal constructions, having said that they provide enough coushioning you will ever need for long hours. But since they are not as flexible as their predecessors they have a bigger footpring which isnt very comfortable carrying always.2. Coming to ANC and Call quality:As many reviewers have already said, its amazing and Mind-blowing you will enjoy the ANC, I use in in Public Transport (Train) and when I have my volume level at 50-60% (recommend not to go beyond that for ear safety) you would barely even hear what the next person sitting to you is speaking unless you pay attention. Call quality is amazing outdoors and indoors it almost matches phone microphone reproduction when indoors but!! They struggle in windy situations so if you on the window seats try avoiding wind for calls.3. Sound quality:I have been using expensive earphones for quite a long time I have my audiophile 1more quad drivers, Sennheiser HD 202, Sennheiser Momentum wired earbuds, Oppo enco x and x2's so I believe I now have some understanding about how a good pair should sound, having said that The default Audio quality is decent also it varies which device you are connected, I wud suggest that you should use them with LDAC enabled all the time!! Its pretty decent nothing mind-blowing but it can be tweaked for amazing soundgazmic experience using app, u can enjoy A.R. Rehman tracks such as Dil Se and experience a variety of instruments audible suddenly.I woud not compare it with bose, Sennheiser Momentum 4, Airpod max, i believe sound is subjective and everyone has to adjust accordingly and be satisfied with their purchase after they have made an investment and not be disappointed due to subjective opinions other have.Concluding this very long review, these are a value for Money pair of Headphones, I got them at a good discount and hence I went with xm5s rather than xm4s. If you want custom eq screenshot and settings I use for tweaking my Xm5s do let me know in reply section.Happy Buying you have made a good decision �",5,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,
BraveNewWorldBraveNewWorld,Sony XM5 is Awesome   But Amazon needs to get it's act together.,"First, let me rant about Amazon.  I bought 'two' (both colors) of these headphones on the 21st of September (the launch date), as a Pre-order.  According to Amazon, I was the first order (basically the 1st customer) to order XM5 on their site in India.I received my headphone on the 18th of October (nearly a month later, and a week after launch)  others that ordered on the 14th Oct were getting them on the same day or the next day (on my PIN code), but Amazon couldn't get them delivered to the very first customer.  (what's the point of pre-order  I decided to escalate the issue on the 15th of Oct when others were writing reviews. This escalated through Amazon's hierarchy.  And these pathetic jokers have just lied to me on the phone and by email.REVIEW Starts here  after 10 days of heavy use!I have become a bit of an ANC headphone collector, and I have SONY XM2, XM3, XM4, and XM5 | Bose QC 35 II, NC700, and QC 45.  (for most I have reviewed here on amazon on their product page)Before XM5, my daily driver was always Bose NC700.  Before NC700, my daily driver was QC 35 II.The primary reason is the multi-point connections and call quality  before XM4, Sony didn't have a multi-point connection.  And the call quality wasn't very good.  So, Bose would be my headphone of choice for 8+hrs a day every day.  Now, my daily driver is XM5.The call quality on the XM5 is phenomenal.  Beyond expectations.  The improvements to ANC have been very infinitesimal since XM3, (to XM4 to XM5).  The XM5's auto-ANC (which can't be turned off) was problematic, with the ANC turning off when you move your head.  The latest firmware update fixes this  and makes this issue less frequent (almost nonexistent).I have always enjoyed the sound quality on SONY, but with XM5, you can definitely notice a change (if you're used to XM3, and XM4 sound signatures).  The EQ-ing helps, only partially.  The bass is no longer as impactful as it is in XM3.Oh did I mention the call quality is amazing?  I take work calls/meetings from coffee shops.  No problemo!Battery, I had to charge this headphone only once.  In total, I have used 60 hrs, in the last 10 days.  (2 headphones fully!).  And 30hrs is exactly as expected (maybe 2hrs here and there).I also feel the best of the ANC is Bose QC 45 (the latest one).  But the problem is the call quality sucks big time.  The previous model, QC 35 II has better microphones for calls compared to the QC 45.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Nagisa11Nagisa11,"Simply amazing, and if you have the budget worth every penny","I have been using Sony noise canceling earbuds for the last couple of years. I own both the XM3 and XM4 models and I have come to really love both the sound quality and the extra features Sony has packed them. Fast bear on android is amazing, it works without any effort. The first time you turn it on or if you turn it on in pairing mode a picture of the headphones will pop up on a nearby android device and you just click connect, it is as simple as connecting air pods to an iPhone.Onto these headphones, they are exceptional. Battery life is amazing, but that is to be expected from any premium wireless over your headphones.The touch controls have a bit of a learning curve, but they are for the most part very good (I have one issue with them, but I will get to that later).The noise cancelling is amazing of course, but what is more impressive is the improvements made to transparency mode. It no longer picks up background noise from fans and cars as much as it used to. Support for Spotify tap means you can launch Spotify, and have it pick up where you left off without even touching your phone.The new safe listening feature tells you if you are listening to music at unsafe levels for too long. It keeps track of how much time you listen at various decibel levels so it can tell you if you have been listening too much.Sound quality is of course very good. Also, Sony's EQ is not the best, but for most people it is more than sufficient. If you like a bit more or less base you can adjust all of that very easily, and it comes with several presets.The issues:I have had three issues with my headphones so far. The first one was a strange bug where it identified to my phone as the FCC registered model number instead of as WH 1000 XM5 with a reset after a firmware update.The next issue is that I have not been able to get it to register with Google's find my device service, it is not a huge deal for me especially because I am less likely to leave the headphones somewhere that I am something smaller like earbuds, but it seems like that can be a bit hit or miss.The last issue is one that I alluded to earlier, and it is with the touch controls. These headphones do not have a physical Google assistant or any digital assistant button, instead you either say the wake word, or press and hold on the radio until you hear a tone. There is a strange bug when I tried to reply to a text that the Google assistant just read to me. It records my reply, but then says to push the Google assistant button to send or press and hold to record the message. You cannot push the Google assistant button, or you can do is press and hold which will just record the message so you cannot send your reply. However, this does not seem to be an issue when you just try to send a text, only when you reply so it is not the end of the world.Well, that ended up being longer than I thought it would. I hope someone has found this helpful because I just spent far too long writing it.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
J & MJ & M,Massive improvement,"The media could not be loaded.                 �These are a huge improvement. I have had the third generation version of these headphones for a few years and they have been great. I decided to purchase these to upgrade and I am very happy with the improvements. The design is much more sleek and modern and the headphones feel lighter. The noise cancellation works really well and I can barely tell they are on my head. The sound quality is great as always. One of the best improvements for me is in the carrying case. The headphones fit perfectly inside the case and there is a compartment with a magnetic flap to hold the charging cable. One of the most annoying things about the previous carrying case for the third generation was that the cable was loosely held inside the case with the headphones making it slightly difficult to take them out and put them into the case. Im very happy with this purchase, highly recommended!",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Alex P. Novickis,"When they are in a working state they are good, but they have a lot of ""malfunctions""","In re to WM1000XM5First of all I will start out saying these are very comfortable, and the sound quality is excellent with Bluetooth when functioning.Battery life is satisfactory the first month of use, although I hear the battery is not replaceable.Noise reduction - works very well. At times, I have a rack of noisy dell servers in my work area - and with the headphones on I can't hear them at all.My usage model may not be what is expected from Sony, so let's go over that first.Primarily, I use these on a windows PC, a Mac, an iPad or iPhone - for music, AV conferencing, video such as YouTube - and gaming.And so, from a usability perspective, there are some further considerationsFirst off, out of the box the headphones have particular settings for power on timeout, audio configuration and ANR feature, that are required to be accessed by the user - and these settings while extremely important - *they are NOT available from the headphones or a PC*, *instead, they are only available from android or iOS devices*.- Out-of-the-Box, the firmware requires an update as some important bugs have been fixed. The update process while working takes *close to an hour* to download the latest firmware due to the speed of Bluetooth. Once the update was complete, the features that are present in the out-of-box version that are not desirable still exist in the updated 1.1.1 version;- No customer documentation shows what features were fixed or enhanced.- Discovering what version your headphones currently have is also not obvious. It's hidden in the iOS app so you have to spend a few minutes going through all the menus.- The iOS app is also trying to sign you up, mine user information, and sell you things, so it's fairly annoying to have that built into the app that is meant for basic headphone settings.- Headphones will occasionally stop receiving audio from the player device for no obvious reason. This falls into several different types of errors. 1) Random turn off (not power or user interaction related, and not related to ""keep on while wearing"" setting, _OR_ (2) no sound is output for headphones even though PC shows connected, the player is playing. _OR_ (3) PC shows no Bluetooth device on occasion. _OR_ (4) video/audio player on the PC will go to a ""paused"" state. - Keep in mind, no interaction by the user was made with the headphones.- In the case the headphones randomly power off, then just turning them back on, and pressing the left button a couple times will restore. It takes about 10-20 seconds to get back to working for the stack to re-establish the connection..- In the case of random pauses of your YouTube player. Using a tap on the right side will restore play, Sometimes many hours will go by without this problem, but at other times this will happen multiple times in a just a few minutes. But it gets better! Sometimes using a tap to start playing again, will start a similar player on the iOS device - even though you never switched from using the PC by any user action.- Using the headphones in a game environment seems to increase the occurrence of these sorts of issues. Having a YouTube player open, but in a pause state while having a game open and audio from the game playing to headphones will complicate matters. Occasionally the sound will stop working here, and tapping the right ear piece in the game will start the YouTube player, but not connect you to the game sound, and sometimes the game sound starts working, and other times you get a mix of both.- Sound delay from sound being played on PC to the time it's actually heard on the headphones is quite noticeable at times and not a fixed but slowly varying quantity. I would estimate as much as 200ms at times.- On occasion the headphones will switch some internal operating mode and then raise or lower the volume of the playback by as much as 40% or so. Completely with no user interaction. This problem does not seem to happen often and seems somehow related to the ANR mode.",1,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Alex,The MX5s are not perfect but I am still happy with my purchase.,"The MX5s are not perfect but I am still happy with my purchase.I originally owned a pair of Bose 700 so my comparison is against them.BuildThe build of the MX5 is on par with the 700s. They have a matte finish which feels nice and grippy to the touch. The buttons have a nice feed back when pushing them. Compared to the 700s the feedback is night and day. For the 700s I would often think that I was hitting the button because it had such lite feedback with a squishy feel.The weight of the MX5 seems to be just a bit lighter than the 700s which I count as a positive because 700s relied more on the headband to carry the weight of the headphones versus clamping force against the ear cups. The MX5s have slightly lighter clamping force on the ear cups but not too little that they feel like they will fall off. They are a great balance of clamping force and weight that neither the headband nor the clamp force feel like they are carrying the full load.  The lighter weight and balanced clamping force make them very nice to wear for long stretches while working. Compared to the 700s I would often start feeling fatigue on my head where the headband would sit because all the weight was supported across it.The ear cups are also a bit wider on the MX5 but a bit shallower when compared to the 700s. I have ears that stick out a bit more so with the 700s the extra room is welcome. The shallower MX5 do fatigue my ears after a while of wearing them but this was after a full day of wearing them.The headband adjustment is a bit sticky for my taste. It's a bit difficult to adjust the MX5s because the fulcrum point get the leverage to adjust them sits much higher along the headband compared to the 700s which I can easily adjust with one hand if needed. However, its the 700s would also lose the adjustment very easily compared to the MX5s when moving around because they rubbed against a headrest.Noise CancellingI won't focus on the sound quality because I am not an audiophile. However, the noise cancelling is fantastic.  I would consider them to be a step above the 700s.Extra SettingsThe app gives you a ton of settings to play around with. The main things I find to be better than the 700s is that the MX5s bluetooth is much better. I live near a rather large radio antenna so interference with wireless signals is extremely high. Walking in the other room my 700s would start breaking and stuttering teh signal before disconnecting. The antenna for the MX5s must be better because I can go a bit give or take an additional 5-10 feet. Also when using connecting to 2 sources the switching is seemless. Once sounds stops on one device the second device starts playing right away. My 700s sometimes would refuse to switch and be stuck on one source until I would restart the device or manually disconnect one source.The app also lets you assign the noise cancellation double a triple tap actions to start a directly interact with a service like spotify. Actually only spotify. I wish the button customization would be opened up to other actions since I don't use spotify its a dead feature for me. The same button can also turn off/on noise cancelling but rather the headphones given a verbal sentence like ""Noise Cancelling 5"" to let me that I am in ambient sound mode. I need to learn the sound of 3 different tones. The 700s would do and I miss that feature and they would also let you customize the noise cancelling levels that you could cycle through. I'd like to be optimistic and say that sony can adjust these features later but they don't appear to be in the habit of adding features to the app. I also own a pair of the XM4s which are the in noise canceling headphones and I haven't notice anything new in the app since I got them.",4,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Miki Villarreal,I have fallen in love,"I have been looking for some good over the ear headphones and seen so many good reviews of these. I decided to try them out and these are some amazing head phones! I recently had to travel and ended up wearing them for 6 hours straight!Battery life: The battery was full and by the end of my travel it dropped to 85% so the battery life is outstanding.Noise cancellation: It was really good and didnt create too much pressure while on. Even when the headphones were off it did an amazing job of damping outside noise. Ex: I was by a VERY loud construction site and once I put on the headphones (turned off) it almost dampened the noise completely.Ambient Mode: Its nice, I will say that in some cases I didnt really use it. For example if you are in a loud environment it will be extremely loud while on. Which makes sense as the point of AMB is to be aware of your surroundings but if you have sensory issues I would be mindful of it. When you do the quick ambient sound its really good and makes what you need to hear very clear. There is very little static noise but if you are listening closely its very faint.Comfort: These are so comfortable and lightweight. Part of the reason I was having difficulty choosing over the ear headphones was because many were too heavy for my liking but when I wore these I forgot I had them on. I only had to adjust them once when it hit closer to the 5 hour mark. There is very little discomfort. My only thing is being that they are so light it feels like they can slip off easily sometimes. When you have them laying on your neck it can be a little uncomfortable at least for me. They landed on my collarbones so there was just hard plastic hitting my collarbones over a bit of time. But that is just me nit picking.Few set backs: the storage of them is a little inconvenient or undesirable. I wish these could fold because the case is quite large and take ups a lot of space especially when you are traveling.Overall: I have really enjoyed the experience with these headphones! I would really recommend these to someone who has auditory sensitivity like myself because they check a lot of boxes! There are only a few things that I wasnt a huge fan of but that was like I said me nit picking.A video that was very helpful in making this decision was by: This is Tech Today on YouTube, they really went in-depth of all the features while also comparing it to different nc/amb headphones!",5,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,

Jake,Fantastic Headphones,"To preface, I did not own the previous iteration of these headphones, the XM4. I did however have the XM3. So most of this review will be a comparisom from the 3 to the 5. That being said, here are my thoughts.Noise Canceling:As always, sony headphones are excellent at Canceling out noise. These headphones have 2 of the noise Canceling chips in them and double the microphones as the XM4. When listening to music the outside world is almost completely silent. Especially lower tones like the running of an engine, whether that be plane or car. Higher, fast tones slip through occasionally but not to any degree that's distracting. I find for the higher tones these headphones are much better than the XM3. Overall the noise Canceling is wonderful and definitely won't disappoint.Sound Quality:I am by no means a professional when it comes to audio. In my own experience I find that these headphones have great sound quality. Better than the XM3 infact. It feels more clear and crisp and the bass has a bit more oomph to it in my opinion. Overall it's great sound and definitely an improvement from the XM3. As said before, I can't compare to the XM4 since I've never had them.Build Quality:This is where the headphones fall a little short. The design, although incredibly comfortable, is rather plastic feeling. It's not cheap feeling plastic, but it's definitely a plastic feeling. They are quite comfortable and I wore them for several hours at a time and never got any pain from them. In addition to the plastic feeling, these headphones also don't fold in on themselves like the previous iterations did. The cups flip over so the headphones can be laid flat but that's it. Subsequently, the included carry case is slightly larger than before. I personally haven't had any  qualms with its size but I think it's something to keep in mind.Overall I think these are a fantastic pair of headphones and definitely worth the price if you're coming from the XM3 or earlier. Sound quality, noise Canceling capability, and comfort of the XM5s is just fantastic and its really a premium experience. Although it's kinda plastic feeling I still feel it deserves five stars especially since the only time I notice the plastic is when they're in my hands and not on my head.",5,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,
Sebas,A downgrade from the XM4s,"I had the XM4s for the past year and absolutely loved them. Sadly, one of the hinges broke and I can no longer use them properly, so I when I saw that the XM5s were on sale for 100$ less I instantly jumped on them, figuring they would be an upgrade to the previous generation, the XM4.I was not impressed by the sound, I firmly place them within the same quality class as the previous generation.I read that they improved on noise-cancellation and microphone quality. Despite this, it seems to me all Sony did was restyle the aesthetics of the headphones. Regarding how they look and feel when wearing, it's a significant downgrade compared to the XM4s. Neither are they as portable due to fix sides, but the plastic material feels cheap, and the overall design makes them really difficult to wear when doing anything but sitting still, as they often shift or even fall off entirely, which was not a problem whatsoever with the XM4s!Overall, the sound is still great, but this is not what a ""new"" generation of an electronic device should be. Quite disappointed.If you are having trouble deciding between the XM5 and the XM4, I advise to stick with the XM4s.",4,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
PC,Buggy and terrible noise cancellation,"I was excited for this, but it's the worst noise canceling headphones I've used -- and I've used most of the previous Sony versions (MX2, MX3, etc). I will be returning these. A huge disappointment,and very poor design choices.How these got out into production is baffling.Absolute worst: the noise cancelling can't be set ""just On"". The silly ""adaptive"" sound cancellation ""feature"" constantly causes noise cancellation to turn on and off, at roughly 10 second intervals. It's very annoying, and causes lots of noise. Sony, PLEASE FIX THIS and allow it to just stay on full noise cancellation! What's the point of cancellation, if it can't be kept On?Also absolute worst: there's a toxic plastic smell from the headphones, that none of the prior versions had. I've washed off all exposed parts, put it into the sun, etc, and still smell this strongly after 4 days. It's not diminishing at all. I have to use a fan to blow the smell away when I'm using these, it's so bad.Also bad: at least three major bugs. Eg the onboard volume control doesn't work, and totally kills the volume when trying to decrease volume by even a tiny bit. The headphones constantly disconnect. Etc etc.All of the above with the latest firmware update as of today.How these got out into production is baffling.",1,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Shawn T. Lamble,Nice Headphones but prefer my XM3's over the XM5's,"I purchased the XM5's early December 2022 as I decided to skip the XM4's. Even though Costco had them on sale for $250CAD. After reading many biased reviews on both XM4's and 5's. Decided I had to judge for myself.First of all the case is just too large for me, preferred the folding models immediately. The quality an finish is substandard so not sure what Sony was doing here. The ear cushions seem cheap and the head band causes me some mild soreness after about an hour. XM3's I can wear all day. I do miss the voice prompts which are in the XM3's but the battery level is still announced when you click the power button.Sound quality is great in both however going back and forth between the 3's and 5's, the difference is quite subtle to me. A great test album for these for me at least is the Atomic Blonde soundtrack. Cat People has a lot going on and if you have a good quality HD track like on Tidal, you'll put these headsets to a good test. The rest of the album has some good beat as well. I'm sure there are better options but that's what I used.For the ANC (noise cancelling), XM3's were much better in 'my' experience. Completely different from what I read in other reviews so I may get flack on this. I first tried them both in my living room with the news channel on the TV. The XM5's allowed a lot of voice in whereas the XM3's did I could barely hear the TV. I played with the XM5 settings but could not improve on this.The next test was flying from Canada to the middle east, 4 different legs. First leg was on a Bombardier Q400 for an hour. On take off I had to take the XM5's off as the propeller buzz seemed to amplify and actually hurt my ears. When the props were adjusted after take off it wasn't too bad but still seemed quite loud. The next leg was with the XM5/A330 8.5 hours. XM5's seemed to be letting a lot of ambient voices and airsflow noise in. When the pilot came on the intercom, it seemed like he was piped into my headset. (Although I experienced this later with the XM3's a bit as well). When someone opened or balled up a cellophane wrapper I could hear it clearly and I found myself checking to see if I had Ambient Sound on. I did not. For the duration of the flight I kept removing the XM5's for a rest as the top of my head would get sore. I also noticed if my head rolled to the side and one of the ear muffs touched the seat, it transferred airplane frame noise in through the headset and seemed to amplify and wake me up. The XM3's did this as well but not nearly as amplified and I could sleep through it.Next leg was an XM3/A330 5.5hrs. Much better experience and better ANC in 'my' personal opinion. Sound seemed about the same although difficult to really  test the sound quality in those environments.I had a shorter 1 hour leg after this which I decided to switch to my new Air Pods Pro2's. The ANC was quite an improvement over my last set and I would hazard to say, almost as good as the over the ear Sony's if you have a good seal. Sound quality a little lower but none the less quite enjoyable and clear.XM5's in general. I turned off the Speak to Chat as it constantly kicked on even in quiet environments. Seemed highly sensitive like when I cleared my throat or was breathing loudly or sometimes at random. The auto-off feature (when you remove them) worked however I left them on over night once and kept hearing voices through the night. Turns out the headset was turning it self on and off so I'm back to turning them off when not in use for any length of time.The battery on the XM5's outperforms the XM3's however even those have a pretty phenomenal battery performance.Consequently, I met a passenger on one of the flights whom was also using the XM3's and he claimed he tested the XM4's and could not justify upgrading from his XM3's.The experience will certainly differ between individuals so don't take my review as gospel. If the XM5's were my first headset I might like them better but unfortunately I have 5 years of using the XM3's to compare to. Maybe I'll find a setting to improve the XM5's but for now they'll just go to the office for conferencing and music there. I know, a lot of moola for a vid conferencing headset. Is what it is. The 3's will remain as my main travel companion for now. Still a phenomenal headset, sound great, cancel noise well enough to satisfy me and fit in my carry-on far better.",3,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

William,Noise Cancelling is horrible - Microphone cuts out,"Overall regret this purchase relative to bose.Pros:- Look good- Sound quality is OKCons:- Active Noise Cancelling is an absolute joke on these.  My cheap Anker earbuds from 3 years ago are more effective at blocking everything from traffic noise to airplane noise.  I did configure the app, and turned off the adaptive sound control so I ould keep Noise Cancelling always on.  When I say it's bad, I mean I can still hear my air filter's low hum through them.  When I wore them in the office, I could still hear almost everything (chatter, vacuums, AC, etc).  Yes it was reduced in volume, but not even close to what you expect from such an expensive pair of headphones.  Totally unacceptable.- Bluetooth drops frequently- Headphones don't auto-reconnect when you put them on.  So they turn off and pause your videos when you take them off, but when you put them on, you have to play the ""power on, wait 30 seconds for it to connect, make sure it's working"" game.  My $30 Anker headphones have this feature, so I expect my $400 Sony's to have it to!- Headband is too tight.  It irritates my jaw after a long time and despite watching youtube videos on adjusting them, I just find I can't get a comfortable setup with them.  They feel very tight like they're pressing in on the sides of my head.  Also, despite being light, the headband is very stiff, so you feel them on your head much more than heavier headphones like BeyerDynamics.Overall, I would strongly recommend not buying these.  Ignore the hype.  When you're planning to spend this kind of cash, it's really worth it to just go to a store and try out a few sets of headphones to see for yourself before buying anything.Update:The microphone has started to randomly cut out in the middle of meetings and phone calls.  I have to turn the headset off and on again to get the microphone to work and it takes a solid 2-3 minutes.  It's SO irritating and completely unacceptable for such expensive headphones.  Again DON'T BUY THESE!  It's problem after problem!",1,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
K. Gilani,Fantastic pair of headphone with one major flaw,"Noise canceling is top notch. Sound quality is fantastic  but my the padding is not thick enough and my ears touch the inside and it gets uncomfortable after a while.Also, the choice of material is questionableas it has a soft plastic covering the cups and within 5 min.

Alan Carratal�,Great headphones if you're serious about music.,"I'm not a music expert, but I do consider an audiophile as I listen to music extensively throughout the day. I have never spent more than $120 on earphones/headphones, but I wanted to know what ""expensive"" headphones would sound like. I purchased these right before they were released, and just in time because I would've bought the WH-1000XM4 instead. Here's my take:I like my music LOUD. At first, the max volume on the headphones was annoyingly low. I then realized that the issue was that the headphones internal volume was linked to the phone volume, but it was not at the highest setting. I had to (on an Android phone) separate both volumes, then unpair the headphones. After this, I paired them again and set the phone volume to max. From there, I increased the volume on the headphones using the touch controls until they were at max (the headphones will tell you.) This was a tremendous change and I am now satisfied with the volume.The bass on these headphones are great, but I like deeper bass, to where it should sound muddled, so these did not meet my expectations. However, the bass is really good and doesn't muddle the rest of the music.The noise cancellation is incredible. There is a HUGE change in what you hear with and without the noise cancellation. It doesn't completely blot out voices (or a television) but with pop music on 30%, you won't be able to hear external noise. The ""see through"" mode (hear through) amplifies the sounds around you so you can hear them while you listen to music, but if your music volume is above 40%, you still won't hear anything from the outside, unless it's very loud.The headphones (with the app) come with a cool feature where they stop playback and enable the ""hear-through"" mode so that you can talk to people without having to either take off the headphones or stop your music. It works well, unless you're like me and you sing the songs you listen to. The music WILL stop if the headphones hear you singing.Another cool feature is that if you remove the left earcup, music playback stops. This is because the headphones detect that you have taken them off. It's not a new feature among earphone tech (I have sub $100 earphones that do the same) but it's a neat trick that is useful to some of us. It appears that the sensor is only on the left earcup because removing only the right earcup does not stop music playback.All in all, I am quite happy with me $400 headphones. The case is sturdy and cool-looking and definitely feels like expensive quality. Battery life is great and charging time is impressive (40 minutes according to my measures).",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Anna Skenadore,Buggy and Glitchy,"I have owned these for a little over a month now and have run into many problems. I use my headphones constantly so I needed something that would be able to have good audio quality, good call sound, good noise cancelling and somewhat functional. I really wanted to like these but unfortunately there were too many problems I ran into that werent user error or miseducation.1. The adjustable ear pieces dont stay. - I tend to readjust these everyday. They slide out further and further until they fall off my head no matter the activity Im doing.2. The touch controls are too sensitive. - This one Im not sure if its just me, but I go through bouts of my headphones pausing/playing my music, activating Siri, turning the volume up and down all while not actually touching them. This tends to happen very fast as if water or something else were touching it. It could be my hair, my sweat or something else. I have tried cleaning them off and moving my hair away and I still continue to have this problem. Its also difficult to hit the right spots on the ear piece all the controls. I end up pausing something when Im trying to turn the volume up and down.3. The audio quality tends to leave sometimes. - I can hear when my headphones need to be restarted. My phone calls will start to crackle and my volume wont be as loud. Its actually happened multiple times when Ive been at full volume but the noise coming out of the headphones barely sounds like 3 notches.4. Phone call quality not as advertised. - I purchased these because I use my headphones for calling because I use my hands a lot while working. I was under the impression my calls would sound clearer and sharper (for the other person) and the audio would focus on my voice a lot more than background noise. Background noise is picked HEAVILY and overpowers my voice while on the phone. I did not expect it to be perfect but for the price I still dont want to step out of a room to take a phone call because of any background noise.5. Charge Time - While I recognize the charge on these headphones doesnt last as long as other brands, I still expect to not have to charge daily or every other day.6. Noise cancellation - While it is actually very good, the ear pieces move once and no more noise cancellation.I do have some pros as well, they arent all bad!1. The controls are clear and very well set in the ear piece - I like not having to take out my phone constantly to use the controls and these headphones have all that.2. Theyre comfortable - I used to get headaches because of too small ear cushions. These ones fit over my ear very good and I dont have headaches wearing headphones anymore.3. Theyre durable and transportable - I like the adjustable ear pieces and being able to turn them in and out. Its easy for certain activities that are physical and I need to adjust. They dont get in the way as often as headphones that dont have this feature. I also tend to bump them less.Overall, these have good qualities but I dont believe theyre worth the price. I think you would be able to find over the ear, noise cancelling headphones with less glitches and issues for a cheaper price.",3,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Verified purchase ,$400 of pure disappointment,"This ""constant adjusting ANC"" is terrible, it's a less annoying version of speak to chat. I do not what to hear changes in the ANC while I'm using these, I do not want to have bleed whenever someone is around me talking. Why can't we manually calibrate the ANC like all the previous models? Give us the option to turn that garbage off! I work in a loud environment and need them to stay exactly how I calibrate them, this model constantly bleeds with this ""always adjusting ANC"" crap. Awful, awful feature that you can't turn off.  The XM-4 were far superior.There is less cushioning and it's harder to create a seal around your ears. If you have big ears, it's even more difficult, if you wear glasses, it's very annoying, if you have big ears AND wear glasses, may God help you. I cannot believe that Sony got rid of the ability to manually calibrate ANC and we are now forced to have this dynamic garbage. You can't touch the headphones, talk, eat, or move your jaw or ear bones without the headphones ""adjusting"" and forcing noise inside while they ""calibrate"". I am going to return these and tell everyone I know just how awful these are. I have already steered 6 people away from this $400 mistake.",1,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Guru PrasadGuru Prasad,Worth the Money!,"Been using this product a couple of months now, im honestly amazed by the audio output (im using the headphones with LDAC codec,32bits per sample,96kHz,990kpbs/909kpbs settings (if you're tech-savy you'll understand that) the audio quality is amazing (for real), and the spatial audio is mind-blowing not gonna lie, oh if you're an iPhone user dont buy this as iOS wont use LDAC codec,and other bit rate/sampling settings, it'll use AAC codec which is not hi-resThough, i love this product, the only con is the weight (this varies from person to person) the headphones are comfortable, but i got neck issues, so i couldnt use the headphones more than 15-20 mins everyday :):",4,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Josh Gurberg,"Great features, but poor fit making the noise canceling sub-par (for me at least!)","I really really really wanted to love these. When upgrading from my cheap noise canceling headphones, I did a ton of research and was thrilled that the XM5s were about to come out and jumped at the chance to pre-order them. While anxiously awaiting delivery, I watched every YouTube unboxing and review and was super excited for the supposed best in class ANC and sound.Unfortunately, my experience did not match all of the youtubers. I found the headphones felt very plasticky and really not premium at all. They also didnt really fit. I dont know what huge headed people these were designed for, but Ive never had headphones before where I did not have to adjust at all from the smallest setting (Im a normal person with a normal sized Head in case you were wondering). The earcups were quite large, but very shallow so I could feel my ears touching the fabric on the inside, which led to an uncomfortably warm experience. The headphones also shifted around on my head very easily. Finally, the ear cups are so large  almost comedically large  that these really dont look so great on your head.That being said, the sound quality was very nice. Not muddy at all. All genres of music sounded great.The real disappointing thing for me was the ANC. It was no better for me than my sub 100 dollar 4 year old noise canceling headphones. I think there are 2 reasons for this. 1. The poor fit offers very little PASSIVE noise cancelation, which is really a key component of keeping the sound out. 2. The app tries to do too much. The ambient mode really is fantastic, but the app is constantly changing the ANC based on your environment and it just gets distracting. I often could not tell if the headphones were in ambient or noise canceling mode. This is not a good thing.Anyway, I wasnt sure if I was just being too critical, so I bought the Bose 700s and wow what a difference. I had that Aha moment I was hoping for with the Sonys. Amazing fit, premium build quality, great ANC, and surprisingly fun sound. Sure they lack some of the cool extra features of the XM5s like speak to chat, auto pause when removing the cans etcbut who cares if they cant keep the sound out (for me at least).So in conclusion, if you dont have a huge head and want a more premium feeling pair of headphones that just do what theyre supposed to do very well, Id recommend the 700s.",3,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

Suzanne,Whats the point of the amazing features if the headset is inconvenient (or even unbearable) to wear?,"Noise cancellation, sound quality, battery life all get a 5/5, the ability to recharge the battery in minutes and last for hours is a force to be reckoned with. But whats the point of all this if the headphones are unbearable to wear?I wear headphones almost every waking moment, and when it comes to being worn, they're a step down in every sense compared to the 1000Xm3 (and likely 1000xm4, they seem to be built the same).The extending part of the headphones (whatever they're called) no longer extends by set amounts, which wouldn't be a problem if they stuck in place! The act of walking around itself causes the headphones to extend and become loose! Not that changes much because the most compact setting on these is too large for my head! The inside of the headphones rests on the helix of my ear, not the lobule, meaning they're pressing down my ears instead of resting on my head.Now, lets say I want to put the headphones around my neck? Good luck feeling comfortable, unlike the xm3 and xm4, you can't rotate the heads on the headphones, meaning the hard outer plastic will be banging against your collarbone while you walk. This also means that if you turn your head too much, gaps appear between your head and the headphone, letting sound leak in. These headphones also lack the ability to fold in on themselves, which makes the most compact storage method for these headphones almost twice as large as for the xm3/4.Please Sony, for the xm6 bring back the design you all were using for the xm3&4, it was amazing. The most ""inconvenient"" thing about them was how I'd never want to take them off because they were so comfortable. The xm5 so much worse to the xm3 I literally returned it only a couple of weeks after dealing with it, found my old half eaten (by our dog) xm3 and manually repaired them because these were just plain unbearable at times to wear.I assure everyone reading this, there is no point in buying these over the xm3/4 that is worth the downsides and inconveniences that come with just the basic act using them.",1,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Anthony Martin,Everything good except..,"1. If you use spectacles, you won't feel comfortable with these, even if you wear it above your spectacles - you will lose the pure noise cancellation quality as sound enters from the space caused by the spectacles.2.

They are like clouds hugging my head.  Sound quality is also phenomenal, very happy there.I live right by a road with a lot of traffic, and I like to sit out back.  I've started using noice cancelling headphones to block out the sound of traffic.  The reviews for these headphones made me expect quality silence, similar to my Bose, but you can certainly still hear the traffic, although muffled.  I'm not sure how they would work on a plane, but I know I'll be taking my Bose.  They seem to function as well as much cheaper pairs I have, although those aren't nearly as comfortable as these.Great headphones, easy to work with, but the noice cancelling just seems lacking.  Maybe there's a way to turn up the noice cancelling effect I'm missing, but I seem to have everything turned up.  I expected silence, it gets rid of the birds chirping, but keeps the cars.",3,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Eighty One,Terrible dynamic noise canceling ruins an otherwise perfect listening experience,"I'm not going to get into the details of how this thing's noise canceling works (you can research it online), but it has some dynamic noise canceling where it only toggles on the ""high"" power noise canceling when the headphones detect that there is loud noise happening around you. Even though there's an app that you can use to modify all sorts of other behavior with this headphone, you CANNOT control the noise canceling strength. So even if you wanted it to always have the high power noise canceling (which is the only good version, since the ""low"" power is not that effective), you can only have it on when the headphones decide you get to have it.To make matters worse, the headphones don't even reliably shift between low/high noise canceling at appropriate times. The worst instance I experienced (which made me return these) was when I was cooking in the kitchen and had the oven range hood fan running. Obviously, this fan is going to make a lot of noise, so it should trigger the high power noise canceling -- which it did. However, the headphones kept switching between high/lower power noise canceling every 10-15 seconds, which made listening to them a really obnoxious experience (as you keep hearing outside noise toggling in an out constantly)!Sony ruined what would have otherwise been the perfect noise canceling headphones. But, nobody seems be talking about this problem very much, which is a shame. Hopefully this review saves someone the trouble of wasting money on these until Sony fixes this problem.",1,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

Ryan Pratt,4 star brought down to 3.5 due to what you get for the price,To keep it short they are Sony headphones - they sound good. After coming from a pair of taotronics though I have been quite underwhelmed by the ANC. While I knew the advertisement was to good to be true I thought many that's why these headphones are $300 more. Should have listened to my gut as there is no noticeable difference in ANC vs my budget taotronics that broke.Before anyone gets angry at my expectations - I know ANC is really only good for the low frequencies - but someone really needs to break the bad news to Sony. In the ad the dude is in a chatty coffee shop and with ANC turned on it goes dead silent. If that is what you expect you'll be VERY disappointed. You could end up thrilled though if anyone ever files a class action lawsuit against Sony for their very blatant false product advertisement.If you have the money to splurge - go for it there is nothing wrong with the product itself - it's in line or slightly above industry standards for ANC - you won't find a better ANC headset. I'd recommend to listen to them first though to have realistic exceptions of ANC in general.If you're on a budget - literally get anything else - but the taotronics are good ANC budget headsets - there model that uses the sony processor is what I am basing this on.I regret the purchase due to the cost - but I give it 3.5-4 because it is an honest review.,4,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

TCG,A missed opportunity,"I have owned the original 1000X (M1) and the M3. Both of those headphones have excellent comfort with large ear cups and rigid headbands with padding. ANC on both of those headphones is very powerful and able to block out low frequency engine and fan noise very well. They have 4 cm drivers that deliver very punchy audio, with the complaint of bloated bass that can be mostly controlled by EQ.I had high hopes for the XM5 model, but overall it is a downgrade in all categories except for microphone quality.COMFORT - The comfort on the XM5 for me is terrible. The headband is limp, thin, and poorly padded. As a result clamp force is weak and nearly all the headphone weight is focused onto 1-2 cm on the top of your hear. This became intolerable for me after 30 minutes. The ear cups are more shallow and my ears become compressed leading to ear pain after 1 hour. The padding is non breathing, leading to very hot ears after a short time. The headphones did not sit firmly on my head and kept sliding around. Making them tighter, though, only exacerbated the pain on the top of the head.AUDIO QUALITY - The drivers have been reduced to 3 cm, and this is noticeable both in reduced maximum sound pressure level, but also much reduced impact. Dynamics are maintained and bass and treble clarity are much improved. If you are not concerned about impact of music, this could be considered an improvement. However, overall, the headphones sound quite sedate, lack incisiveness, and generally lack the excitement of the prior XM series.ANC - The ANC quality is much reduced compared with the prior models in the XM series. If you stand right next to an AC unit or fan you can hear the ANC turn on after about 5 seconds and powerfully reduce the noise. However if you walk a few feet away, the ANC goes back into low mode and the noise returns. Even worse, if you are across the room the ANC appears to turn off nearly entirely, letting in most of the noise. This is not user error where I have the ambient sound let through. The ambient mode was turned to off and I could observe reduction in external noise in ANC on vs off modes. However it is much reduced compared with MX1 or MX3, perhaps only 30% the strength of those.PORTABILITY - The MX5 do not fold, and equally frustrating you have to fully compress the telescoping band into itself before you can place in the case. The left arm of the headband had 5x more resistance than the left leading one side to auto-elongate while on my head, which also was a poor experience.Imagine if the XM5 were the prior model and the XM4 is the current one. They could advertise the following changes: ""Since the last version we updated with larger, punchier 4 cm drivers, added extra padding to the headband and made the cups larger with more room for your ears, and boosted ANC to function at full power to ensure no leakage of noise"".",3,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

They're lightweight, comfortable and I love the material!The sound is great: crisp, smooth and pops!I love the smart features of them pausing and playing depending on whether they're on or off your head. These are my first headphones where you can connect to 2 devices simultaneously and that's game changing for me.Now for the things that I don't like. I don't like that you can't fold them. I don't know who thought that would be good be idea but I definitely hate that you can't.Volume: I'm coming from the XB900N series. Those headphones are like about 3 years old. You can definitely tell that the volume from these are not on par with those. If the volume from the N series produced a level 100 volume than these are are around 90. Maybe it's a good thing so people won't hurt their hearing but I do wish they were a little louder.Bass: I know the N series is supposed to produce superior bass but I feel like the bass on these on these are perhaps a tad low. The difference between those 2 is huge.

Abhishek Sharma,Amazing Headphones at a discounted Price,"I have been using Sennheiser HD 4.40 BT for the last 5 years. The headphones sounds good, but they are uncomfortable to wear for long hours. That made me look for a new headphone. I got 1000XM5 at a discounted price of ��21500 using SBI credit card. Received both the aux cable & usb cable in the bag. These are very lightweight & can be worn for longer periods without any ear pain or discomfort. ANC is good, it does not create too much pressure on ears. Reason why Im saying it because I use airpods pro on a daily basis & it creates lot of pressure on ears. So having experienced both, I would say ANC is a bit better on airpods pro, but with more pressure on ears. The sound quality of XM5 is amazing, its bass heavy. Watching movies or tv shows using these is just incredible.

ag,ANC so good,"I bought this primarily for use in the home office because my kid gets noisy around the house. This does its job well enough. The auto optimizer is great and you can hear it adapting and the ANC getting stronger when the construction machines outside my house start operating. I had the version 1 of this series (MDR-1000XM or XM1) and the ANC is noticeably better.Comfort: I wear glasses and these have the same problem as the XM1s had and they cause the specs to dig into my head. This gets uncomfortable after a while. I tried the Bose QC 35 series and they are much more comfortable with glasses. But their ANC is not as strong as the sony's.Bluetooth connectivity: They work flawlessly with a single connection and the range is also great. I can walk around the whole house without the signal dropping. The problem is in multi device connectivity. When connected to two devices, it's not so great at switching to the correct host. Like say it's connected to my laptop and phone and I play music on my phone. It will stay connected to the laptop even though nothing is playing on it. But when a phone call comes, it will switch over to the phone. So the switching seems to be profile dependent. My previous Bose soundsport's were better at such decisions.Sound quality (music): I can say there's a small degradation in sound quality since XM1. While the XM1 had great sound across most frequencies, these (XM5s) are more bass heavy and light on mids and trebles. I haven't played with the EQ enough yet so maybe this is fixable.Sound quality (calls): Much improved microphones as compared to XM1s. I no longer have to switch to the laptop's mic for the meetings.All in all, I don't regret my purchase. These do their ANC job perfectly and that's mostly what mattered to me. I'll probably buy another headphones for music.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
vivekvivek,It's Noise cancelation not termination.,"Well have to say the all new sony xm5 meets all of my requirements. Must say has better noise cancelation than the bose qc45. Since I have sharp �� i could still hear human voices around me well that's just me and it might vary person to person. Top class bass and sound quality, I'm having a lot of fun with LDAC and high-res audio in the apple music. It's an over kill pair of headphones and surely it's industry leading. The call quality is fantastic, only picks up on the voice and cancles out other nosie no matter how loud the noise gets it extracts the voice and nothing more which is insane.I can go on and on with the unlimited features that these headphones has to offer just go for it without any second thoughts you will be more than happy. Works great with Microsoft teams as well unlike bose.Cons:-1.Fingerprint magnet2.No water resistance hence cannot be used in the gym.3. Clamping force could be improved.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Gerald Kletke,Sound Quality (And More!) Separates This One From The Rest!,"I did months and months of research into various brands of higher end headphones (Bose, Sennheiser, Beats, etc.) looking for some decent sounding headphones. I really didnt consider looking into Sony as I had heard much more about the other brands, until I started reading up on all the reviews. There were so many mentions of the Sony WH-1000XM line and how they outperformed the others that I began to give them some serious thought. Boy, am I ever glad that I did!While most of the references were about the WH-1000XM4, this newer model is even better!The Sound (most important to me): I have to admit that I was blown away by the quality of sound from the first testing. It was such a difference, clearer and more �pure� sounding. Acoustic, full on band, live recordings all sound fuller and richer (even more so with Sonys 360 degree sound enhanced music! Just amazing!). To say Im satisfied is a bit of an understatement.Noise Cancellation: Absolutely wonderful. A feature I honestly thought I wouldnt need (I use my headphones mainly while I work from home), adds to the focus on the sound quality and keeps me from being disturbed by outside influences.Battery Life: Varies. Depending on how much you use Noise Cancellation, the volume of playback, and of course the duration of playback. I personally think the battery life is more than adequate for an average to higher listener as my first full charge lasted 3 days of almost continuous playback (3 full 8 hour days at work plus after work listening for a few hours)Packaging: Comes with a nice case for storage, but a perplexingly small charging cable (I think its 1.5� long?). I had to buy a longer one just so I wouldnt have to charge the headset on the floor.Special �Cool� Extra: The free downloadable phone app that enables you to customize features of the headphones (update the firmware, equalizer, Noise Cancellation settings, much more). It also allows you to know exactly how much charge is left in your headphones so you dont suddenly hear that �low battery� message when it reaches 10%. There really is too much to tell about the app and all its uses, but just let me say that after some extensive poking around, I am still discovering new things!Overall: This is the higher end headphone to beat! Hands down. The quality is stellar. The headset itself is solid and made to last. Sony won me over all the rest and I aint looking back!",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
DimaDima,fantastic headphones in every possible way!,"I travel for work, take a lot of planes and talk on the phone and work in industrial environment where noise level goes to over 95db... After losing two sets of earbuds in airport (200$) decided I am not good with small items (dropped box once on an airplane, had to wait for entire plane to leave to look for one of the buds lol it rolled 5 seats ahead, laughed at the time, luckily overlay was 4 hours.After losing 200$ worth of earbuds I've decided it was enough and started researching Bluetooth over ear headphones, from my experience Sony made very good headphones (first pair i bought 20 years ago) in fact i think Sony makes the best sounding portable speakers and headphones, but it is my own opinion.I got these headphones and kept them in package to do more research online and watch more reviews and what I've found that these headphone made sense. Well, let me tell you - these are amazing! One push of a button and a CNC router cutting wood at 95db disappears! I never had noise cancelling headphones and i was stunned when i experienced that feature, but when someone is talking to me i can hear them clearly without hearing the machine in background! I'm mind blown! Sound quality is fantastic as well, i enjoy quality sound, own a pair of Beyerdynamic 770dt 80ohm and these Sonies  are just as enjoyable to listen, maybe lag behind the Beyers with quality of sounds, but still sound incredible and I don't have to carry a portable amp to listen to them lolbattery life is another feature that I'm amazed with, listened all day and didn't discharge, i cant say i listened for 30 hours without charge yet, simply because i don't want to run out of battery while I'm listening to an audiobook in an industrial facility, but 10 hours at a time they lasted no problem.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

REVIEWER REVIEWER ,Hail the ANC King ,"Have been using an excellent pair of ANC earphones. So when I first used these out of the box, I wasn't impressed with the ANC (unlike the rest of the world).You start using the ANC and set the custom equalizer (screenshot attached), these really start to shine. They'll take a day/two to actually start showing the magic. Here's everything to love about these:- Unboxing experience is great (Tip: Before pressing the on/off button on the headphones for the first time, put them on and then press the button. The VA will guide you on the further steps)- The Noise Cancelling (Bummer), The sound (Play the 360 Spatial Audio video on YT)- Volume at 60% should be enough for most people to enjoy the music.- Extremely comfortable to wear for long durations and these charge really fast.- The Bluetooth range is good enough to roam around a duplex without worrying about fades.- The app gives enough customizability freedom. The ""Safe Hearing"" feature is a ++- The looks people will give you while using these.What's not so good:- Sony should hire a UI/UX engineer to rebuild the app interface. In terms of look and feel if the headphones are a 10, the app is a 2. Does the job but not so pleasant to look at.- The black color is a fingerprint magnet. It still looks dope thou.Worth the purchase!",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Worm,Its not 100% Noise Cancellation,"If you want 100% Noise Cancellation, use ear plugs that are made for it not a pair of Bluetooth Headphones. Does it work great if youre playing music or something, yeah. Having Noise Cancellation with music playing does help focus more on the songs. I wouldnt rate the �Surround Sound�/360 audio as mind blowing, but it does the job. That being said, its amazing how clear some sounds can be, such as in Call of Duty or Minecraft. Zero disappointment if you want clear audio since the ear cushion works wonders (Not sure how long they will last though). As for charging and using the audio Jack at the same time since Bluetooth doesnt work while its charging, I found it a horrible experience. Just get a good charging brick, a decent length usb-c cable and charge the thing once it reaches 20%. Go eat, take a walk or do it in your sleep but that battery wasnt lying about being able to reach 30 hours. Though I would only limit it to 20-24 hours before checking the battery limit by pressing the power button again and hearing it tell you the power level. I dont plan on killing the battery health and you should too for this price point. As for the range, Bluetooth 5 is impeccable especially with a quality device and limited walls between you, your pc and the kitchen. As for volume control, it changes it by small increment, though holding on to the right pad with your palm does activate transparency mode and lower the volume so you can hear someone talk. Downloading the app will show you a few things btw. Its just a little overpriced by maybe $80 bucks, but you cant deny the microphone quality. Its quite good on mobile but if you use OBS to record there is always that noise. That being said, it does isolate my voice quite well in a loud environment and the Noise Cancellation keeps me from hearing anyone talk though to how high I have the volume playing my content to immerse myself. But like I said, without any content playing you can still hear stuff through the noise cancellation but once you play something else on top its gold. If there was once feature they shouldve added it would be dual control on both ear cuffs instead of just the right. Im not left handed but it would increase usability since I dont always get the action I want done though to me lying down or whatnot and my hand gesture was a little off from the four main directions. Also can we get a PC App or settings? I hate having to use my phone to change a few things such as the level of noise cancellation or shutting off/on the gesture control. There are times when I forget to turn them back on and when I switch to PC/Mac I have to go back to my phone to turn those controls back on. If there is a desktop App, me not so bright. That being said, its a good product, just a tad overpriced. Lets see how long I can keep it alive.",4,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Lance L.,Decent headphones,"The overall build quality was great with the use of some high-quality plastic(or some other nice and light material) The new design didn't seem to impact functionality although it might help with the duration of the headphones by removing the hinges. However, to put the headphones back into the case, they had to be fully un-extended, which means every time I took it out I'd have to take some time to adjust the length again. Speaking of the case, the magnetic cable slot from the Bose headphones' case was nice and worked perfectly. The only complaint about the case is probably the zippers consistently get stuck near the two ends. To the core now, the sound is excellent as always with Sony headphones. Personally, I thought it was slightly dull/dark with default settings and wasn't massive improvement from the previous gen. The EQ in the app did help tremendously and clearly reflected the changes I made and it was able to tune to my sweet spot. To be fair, I'm no expert in audio so take this solely as an opinion base review.In terms of the ANC, Sony nailed it again and it blocked pretty much anything... Meanwhile, be cautious when you cross the street with these on although I was able to hear some car sounds from larger cars. The ambient sound was pretty similar to the previous(meaning it's good) but I'd say it's not as natural as the Airpods series(Airpods Pro I'm comparing to here since I'm too poor for Pro Max :).Up until this point, it probably seems like a 5 star review but the following would be my complaints. First of all, the quick attention mode is a great feature but it would only work on the right side of the headphone as almost all other features on this headphone. All touch controls are on the right earcup while the left just has 2 buttons for ANC/AMB and power plus the wire jack. It'd be nice if there was the option in the app to choose which side the touch controls are on or just make it work on both sides. This is not possible and understandable if there's never a panel to do touch control on the left but that's probably good thing to add for the future. Also, I'm aware that I could literally just flip the headphone(as they seem to be identical except for the buttons) and wear the Right on my left year, but why?Anyways, moving away from the left and right issues. Something minor would be that I'd personally like to customize my touch controls but that didn't seem to be an option in the app as I've looked in and out for it. Not to say that there are any controls missing but I'd prefer to customize it.Lastly, something about connecting to 2 devices simultaneously is that it works but not seamlessly. I'm thinking it's more of an issue with the devices that I'm using(iPhone and iPad) which don't work exactly like devices in the Apple ecosystem. For example, when I'm connected to my phone and playing music on it, the headphone doesn't change to iPad automatically when I start to play a video on the iPad. To make it change devices (I've tested it multiple times), I need to pause the audio on the current device in order automatically move to the other device. This is still easier than disconnecting and reconnecting devices but could be improved(maybe?).Perhaps some of these issue could be fixed by updates perhaps not. I'm giving this 3 stars mainly for the fact that the price increased and not all of the features are completely flawless. I don't think the price for an upgrade from the XM4's or other headphones in similar price range is worthy.  Don't get me wrong, it's great and all, just not worthy as an upgrade.",3,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Eric W.,"Love them so far, but not a huge improvement over previous model","So far they are great, but the difference between these and the previous model is not a significant one. Sound quality is a little better, the sliders that commonly broke on the previous models are a different style now so I think they will last much longer. These feel great and look great, my only (minor) complaint so far is they no longer tell you ""power off"" when you turn them off and they no longer tell you ""noise canceling"" or ""ambient sound"" when you switch between modes, they just have a series of beeps you have to memorize. Also the XM3 and the XM4 would creak sometimes when you put them on or take them off but so far I have heard no creaking with these! Happy so far, but not worth the upgrade for everybody.

Richie VargheseRichie Varghese,5-star product,"Sony WH-1000XM5 is an awesome product in this category with great ANC, sound quality and extreme comfort wearing them.Looks are very premium, even to the touch of materials and cushion. Very lightweight given the size and quite comfortable to wear for longer period of time.The carry bag comes with a USB C cable and a 3.5 audio jack.ANC is very superior in isolating even in a crowded environment, even putting it on without any playback is really good. If you have used a premium TWS from pixel or airpods, it's a step-up even from the great ANC provided on these TWS.Ambient mode (transparent mode) is great at making the voices around sound clearer. The feature for automatically adjusting ambient mode is pretty convenient (available on the app), it automatically switches to ambient mode when walking or running based on the location. You can also adjust how much ambient noise should be let through (even suppress background noise and allow only voice frequencies through which is very good.Sound quality is really good, but it's very subjective, I guess. For me, it's been really great, you can check out the video linked below to get a full picture of it.Some noteworthy features:Speak-to-chat (enable on the app) - switches to ambient mode from ANC when u starts speaking, might be an inconvenience if you're someone who sings along but it's a huge convenience otherwise.Multi-point connect - works pretty much like on pixel buds pro or other TWS with support for it, but the audio switch is much quicker.5-band EQ is available with 3 custom setup option.watch this for a good review and comparison with other products around this range https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlQaZDw25Uo&t=270s",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

Brocjames,Best cans in the game,"Im not a huge audiophile so Im not going to bore you with a bunch nerd audio stuff. Ive had these headphones for a couple weeks and I couldnt be happier. Even with the $350 gut punch. First the ANC is the best Ive ever encountered. Im a machinist and work 11-12 hours in a machine shop with lots of machines making lots of noise. I put these cans on and suddenly Im immersed in the quietest of libraries. Features like the speak to chat and cupping your hand over the right can to pause the music and instantly hear ambient noise. I was skeptical and thought they might be a gimmick. Boy was I wrong they quickly became an invaluable part of these headphones, as I mostly use them at work. Not having to constantly move one can to the side constantly to converse with a coworker or listen to something important is the pinnacle of convenience. The app is also incredibly useful. It has an equalizer and allows you to customize the amount of ambient sound that comes through. As I said Im not a big audio nerd but the sound quality is the best Ive experienced in any headphones and I own more than a few pairs. I forgot to mention they are incredibly comfortable. I can wear them my entire 11 hour shift no problem.Ill add to this review as I use them. So far, the only main drawback is the lack of water resistance.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
pizxer,Not as good as everyones been saying,"Update-as of 7-20-22, I'm returning these cans. The ear cups leak so much.  Even that tiny space that is created by my glasses is enough to drastically reduce the ANC which isn't so amazing to begin with. The head grip is shoddy. C'mon-do better, Sony.  I was so excited.  Guess I'm going to see how the latest Bose cans compare.  It's a sad day.Im a headphone fanatic, noise-cancelling addict. Ive been rocking AirPod Pros and decided to jump into the new XM-5s -largely because of Flossy Carters rare �quad major go�, but after three days with them, I have to said that the noise cancelling isnt nearly as good as the Air Pods. I have The noise cancelling on max setting, good ear cup seal, and I hear running water and people talking quietly next to me. With my Air Pods, I can hear nothing but music. Okay, the good, the sound quality is decent.  You know, not booming bass, but balanced-ESPECIALLY when used with EQE or even Sonys watered down EQ app.  The battery life has been very good-I get about 30 hours and the touch controls are solid. Also. Yesterday, I was on Main Street with racing, noisy after market exhaust, blasting stereos and I made a call. The caller had no idea. She thought I was sitting in a quiet office. Thats a very amazing thing. I mean, I do like these headphones very much. The build is light, but sturdy, they charge HELLA fast. I had 60 percent and plugged in for15 minutes and got up to 90%. Is it worth $421? No, I think the Xm-3s would have worked just as well. Am I returning these? No, dont want to hassle and I do like them, but if youre looking to buy, Id wait for a sale or go with a lower model and if you are okay with 6 hour battery life, go with AirPod Pros or for $400, get two pairs of AirPod pros. These Sony cans are good for the office, but you cant wear them in 80 degrees weather and you certainly cannot  jog with them. I hope this review helps you.

Stevan,Really bad noise cancellation on my unit,"This review was written on May 31, 2022PROS:The sound quality and battery life are absolutely amazing. They are leaps and bounds better than the AirPods max in terms of those two things. The transparency mode is good, it is not AirPods max clear but it is absolutely workable plus I dont use it much so I dont mind.CONS:They are not very comfortable on my ears. I dont have big ears but they touch the foam on the inside and start to become painful after an hour. My hands were very clean and washed seconds prior to opening and holding the headphones and within seconds they were covered in finger oils. This continued happening throughout the day.Big issues: The noise cancellation is embarrassing  bad on my unit. I went into this with absolutely no expectations for it to be better than my AirPods or xm3s and was HUGELY disappointed. I really dont understand what I am doing wrong or if my unit is defective. I have tried nearly everything other than contacting the company directly because for a product that everyone is praising for good ANC, mine suck really really badly. A lot of people seem to be having this issue. To put into perspective what is happening kinda, i put on a constant sound at 60-140hz and try my AirPods, I hear nothing. I put my xm3s on, I hear nothing. I put on my xm5s and can hear it very clearly. I repeated this test multiple times along with a real world test with wind and people talking and the xm5s, even after giving them time to adjust their adaptive ANC, were performing significantly worse than the same product 2 generations old, and my AirPods maxes.Conclusion: The headphones are really good, sound quality is unmatched by any other Bluetooth headset, and in general, the most optimal combination of everything you could ask for in a daily use headphone. Unfortunately I think my unit is either defective or the software is broken considering the very inconsistent performance among users and my pairs almost complete lack of any active noise cancellation.If possible I would like to speak to someone about this and get my issue resolved because I so badly want to daily drive these headphones. They would deserve of a 5 star rating if they are able to give the same ANC as everyone else is praising them for.Hope this helps future buyers",2,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Brian,"Drove me insane, most regretted purchase ever, now in the trash. ZERO stars.","I found my Beats Studio 3 headphones to perform better, unfortunately they broke [physical accident]. These headphones are definitely more comfortable, but that is all. For noise cancellation, they do a mediocre job when it comes to predictable noise (e.g fans or lawn mower). When it comes to less predictable noise (e.g. clanging dishes, hammering), they just don't cut it at all. Mine also seem to decide they are just going to turn themselves off while actively connected to a device and playing music. This is my second Sony product in a short period of time after not having bought from them for years, and I feel that they are not at the top of their game anymore, and will steer clear of their product in the future.Nov 2022 Update:These continue to disappoint at an epic level. With the latest September update, they continue to turn themselves off. I've found the touch sensitivity is so bad, if you are outside and happen to brush by a bush, it is enough to change settings. After a plane flight the other day, I found that they failed miserably there as well. Sure, they block out some noise, but not for what I paid - maybe 1/4 of what they are selling for. I am about to spend money that I shouldn't on a new pair of Apple headphones, because I am about to physically break these. I also tested them against a white noise machine that was 50 feet away, and they failed to block out this steady sound, even with music playing at a comfortable volume.End of Nov 2022, and end of the headphonesI contacted Sony through chat, and they had me reset them. Then, all of the settings were disabled again. This did absolutely no good. The headphones continued to turn on/off the music, and turn on/off the level of sound control. I got so mad this morning that I ended up smashing/breaking them, so they are now in the trash.Thanks a lot of this useless product/app/support Sony.

Customer 12312412,Noise cancelling doesn't stay on and customer support is useless,"I used the Xm3 headphones for years, but the aux plugin on them has recently stopped working, so I decided I would 'upgrade' to the newest version of the Xm series of headphones. Putting the quotation marks around 'upgrade' being very important here. The noise cancelling on the Xm5's are 'adaptive' by default and you can't change or disable it. This means that if there is any change in noise around you whatsoever, these 'noise canceling' headphones will stop noise canceling and just blast your ears with the sounds coming from around you. This makes them completely useless for me because I have a loud air conditioner in my room. My Xm3's had no problem canceling out the noise, but these Xm5's stop canceling noise anytime it picks up any noise coming from me, such as the very, very, quiet sound of me swallowing, sipping water, talking to a mic, and sometimes even breathing.  The sound quality appears to be a downgrade from the Xm3's, but it is difficult to compare them fairly due to how terrible and intermittent the noise canceling on the Xm5's are.

Andrew,Review After 2 Months,"Quick take aways:Without an EQ, the headphones have a very very dark sound signature (I was not a fan)Sound very good for Bluetooth headphones with EQ, sound okay when wiredANC seems to be decent, lot of customisability in the appANC works well in standalone mode (without pairing)Battery life is goodNo form of sweat/water resistance is a minus but can be worked aroundHigh noise floor (if you care about that sort of thing)Optional pause with take off and resume with put on feature is amazing!As a preface, the Sony WH-1000XM5 are my first set of ANC headphones. I would consider myself a mild audiophile (I have a DAC, AMP, and too many headphones). With that said, everyone's ears are different so take this with an extra pinch of salt.Out of the box experience:  The packaging was quite nice. It included a hard-shell carrying case, USB-C to USB-A charging cable, 1.2m long 3.5mm cable, and the headphones. The connection process for new devices is wonky and leaves a bit to be desired. The initial pairing did not work until I installed the Sony Headphones Connect app from the appstore. After this, you have to power off the device then power on and hold the power button for 5 seconds to enter pairing mode (confirmed by a vocal ""pairing"" from the headphones).  The sound signature left a lot to be desired. For a bit of background, my favourite type of headphone is flat/neutral with a balanced sound signature. I enjoy heavy bass in electronic music and am sensitive to loud highs/mids (I get listener fatigue quite fast from it). I enjoy a lot of variety when listening to music an will try most things out. In particular I regularly listen to Classical, Avant-garde, Experimental, Easy listening, Electronic, Contemporary folk, Latin, Jazz, Rock, and some Traditional folk. I don't tend to listen to much Blues, Rap, or Hip Hop. I occasionally listen to mainstream-Pop and Country.Without EQ, the sound signature is very very dark. The bass is very punchy and present, the mids are recessed, and the highs have their edge taken off. I was not a fan of it for anything but electronic tracks with no vocals and heavy bass. Even then, it wasn't particularly amazing. Anything with vocals will sound horrendous (again, with no EQ) as the bass frequencies in voices will be very pronounced.  The ANC worked well for me out of the box. For the open mode, I set it to let near voices through and ambient noise out. I use them with eyeglasses but the ANC still seems to work well. They do a particularly good job of filtering out A/C noises, the electronic whine that appliances generate (not all people can hear this), and running water. The ANC tends to struggle with erratic high pitched noises (as I understand it, most ANC systems do). However, it will dull the noise a tad through both the closed back headphone and ANC component.Adaptations  Since I was not a fan of the sound profile out of the box, I set up an EQ profile with these headphones. The Sony Headphones Connect app includes an EQ but I found it to be extremely limited in terms of customisability (I did not like any of the presets that were offered) and not very user friendly. Due to this, I set up my own external EQ using AutoEq (on github) as a starting point. After fine tuning it to my preferences, using the headphones became a much much better experience.  They sound very good for Bluetooth headphones. For genres where I like more bass, I strongly prefer the Sony headphones over my Sennheiser and prefer the Sony to my Bose.  In wired mode, the headphones definitely sound better but no where near as good as my other wired headphones. If I'm attached to a wire, I would rather just switch to another pair of headphones. With that said, they do sound better if you leave the headphones on while connected with a cable.  The ANC works well for me. If I use them for noise canceling without music, it can get unsettlingly quiet in the mornings (which is a great thing). Around others, particularly in the kitchen, the headphones do a very good job of dulling and eliminating noises. The pass through function works well in the event of conversation. I am a very quiet eater but these headphones did a great job canceling out all noises while I ate. I don't use these headphones outside, so I do not know how well they perform with nature's noises.  The gesture controls included are useful but a bit too involved to be my go to. If I have physical access to my device, I prefer to use that to control the music. However, the pause on take off feature is amazing! It consistently pauses my media any time I have to take my headphones off and resumes right where it left off and soon as I put it on. Simply magic is the only way I have to explain it (the function can be turned off if you don't like/want it).",4,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Blayre C.,"Yep, buy them. Just do it.","If you're thinking about buying a pair of great over-ear headphones without jumping on the air max ""trendy"" bandwagon, then you found them. These are FANTASTIC. I have used these every day since buying them 5 months ago - at the gym, at home, for work calls, etc. and they have met all my expectations. The noise canceling is fantastic, almost too good sometimes. The fit is SO comfortable and lightweight you could wear them for hours without having any ear pain (I've literally fallen asleep wearing them). I wear them to the gym to weightlift and sweat a normal amount, and have had no issues so far. Might not be something you want to do intense jumping or HIIT workouts in, since they do move around a bit - but that goes for ALL over ear headphones. Running with them on was no problem.When looking to make an investment in a pair of headphones I went in-person to Best Buy and tried these compared to the Apple Air Max and these won by a long shot. Sure, ascetically the air max's look nice and they are definitely the ""it-girl"" accessory right now but the quality of sound and the weight/comfort of these truly is just so much better. Only thing I agree with is they are a finger-print magnet but be good about cleaning your devices and its not an issue. The volume control / change song features on the ear cups is also something that takes some getting use to but I use my phone or apple watch to change those settings anyways so I don't find it to be an issue that impacts its quality.Overall, would recommend to anyone.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Anonymous,Best Headphones I have ever used! Love them!,"As both an audiophile and a professional DJ I have gone through, used, abused, and paid out a LOT of money for headphones thus far in my life and these are by far the best I have ever used. I have used Beats, Senheisers, Pioneers, Audio Technica, Shure,... You name it and I have probably had it in my gig bag or sitting next to my home system at some point or another. These Sony's top them all. Not only do they sound great, have great noise canceling, are crystal clear for phone calls, and give solid performance for those late night gaming sessions but they are so light and comfortable you hardly notice that you have them on. The minimalist design of both the headphones and the case make them easy to transport while taking up minimal space in the gig bag. Like most headphones of this type you can also run them wireless or using a 3.5mm aux cable, which makes them very versatile and still a viable option for pulling out the old iPod Classic or vinyl turntable and zoning out to tunes Old School.If you are on the fence or even considering a new headphones purchase, just get them. You will not regret it and will likely, like me, be pleasantly surprised at how good these really are.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

DeanDean,Great upgrade from the XM4s,"The media could not be loaded.                 �The design changes, overall comfort (including level of head pressure) and potability have all been significantly improved. I actually disagree with many of the editors reviews, it's much better that it doesn't fold twice, the case is much thinner to transport. This also helps make the headphones much more durable overall. In terms of the previous generation model, put quite simply, sound quality is more in line with a neutral profile sounding acoustically tuned pair of reference headphones. Noise cancelling and transparency modes are a night and day difference with respect to the 1000XM4s, but both are still excellent pairs of headphones. The improvements here are well justified for an upgrade. Also the sound profile of the previous generation WH-1000XM4s can be easily restored by using the ""excited"" EQ setting in the companion app settings. Those carbon fiber dual drivers, 8 noise canceling mics and custom audio co-processor Sony keeps referring to in the marketing materials, are genuinely significant. If you're coming from the previous generation model, the differences are immediately noticable. The price has increased but considering there's a chip shortage and they improved literally all the right aspects of this new pair. It's justified. Well done Sony.

AR,big flaws that sony won't fix even with software update.,"Given the price of the product, it has big flaws that sony won't address in software updates.1. The auto ANC will keep on changing noice cancellation levels depending on surrounding. Hence, if you have a fan rotating or people talking nearby, you can feel the anc lagging and noice creeps in periodically. Sony won't give a software update to set a fix level for ANC.2. The surround sound is a gimmicky feature. Good luck finding apps/websites that support it. Sony should partner with at least a few major movie/song streaming websites to support surround sound experience. Instead, they give free trials to some apps that have very poor selection of songs.3. The sound quality out of the box is not good for what you pay. You need to play around with the equalizer. You can feel lack of clarity which was present in xm3 amd xm4.4. A couple of times, it was playing songs when headphones were not worn and pauses them when you wear them. This was some wierd bug that happens with it doing on ear detection. This happens when you switch between multiple devices and have multi-device connect on.5. The headphones don't give a tight enough fit on head. Hence, they will slip when lying down or walking fast.6. Ambient mode has lots of hissing noise creeping in.7. In teams call on windows, it makes a lot of hissing sound even when everyone is on mute.8. If you play some song, take them off and put them in case, they will play the song inside the case because the provided case has padding which it thinks is a ear and plays the music. Because of this reason, battery will also drain a lot.9. The swivel on two earcups have a plastic feel and do make creeky sounds often.10. if you use provided wire (generally when battery is low), mic does not work on it. microphone works only in wireless mode only.11. the type c cable provided can be increased in lenght slightly more so that it is useful in some scenario. Currently, it seems to be of no use.Sony should have done more refinement before launching them. Honestly, if you try xm4 or xm3, they will provide comparable experience and better experience in sound. Only mic department had been improved.",2,B09XSDMT4F,Colour: Silver,SONY,Headphones,
NemivikramNemivikram,Just awesome��️,"Received on 12th October, this review is after three days of usage. No issues with battery, sound quality, noise cancellation, Microphones all works perfectly. Charging speed is mind blowing, this pair looks heavy but the comfortness I get with the memory foam is just awesome. All features works perfectly and got one update too. The touch panel is also good. The only disadvantage I am facing is this can't be paired to multiple devices easily unless You switch On multiple device pairing(which uses AAC codec). To use LDAC on multiple device, you need to initialize the headphone to default state and then pair with other devices( After pairing it is easy to connect on various devices). Thats why I reduced one star in Bluetooth connectivity.",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
M. Joy,Not worth the cost,"I read the reviews from those claiming professional audio experience with considerable respect and anticipation.  I enjoy high quality music components - my taste has always been heavily rooted in 70s Rock.As a drummer, and a serious music collector, I still enjoy the drive, spectrum, and talent that produces each part of the music - even though it is now rarely evident in todays world of �noise�.I used a set of Bose QC35 headphones as my means of listening to music while mowing grass on my ZTR.  These worked sufficiently while also giving an impressive rendering of music fidelity - all things being considered.After a few years I wanted to see if an upgraded setup was available  - so the research, shopping, and review reading led me to buy these Sonys - despite that brand name not being one commonly associated with HQ headsets in the audiophile realm.Honestly - �overall� - It has been a disappointing decision made thus far.  I get the feeling that the ANC is where the tech was implemented, not necessarily in the fidelity, styling, or sound drive.Other reviews adequately describe the somewhat cheap materials used.  The lack of any manual buttons or controls on the set, coupled with the total lack of any printed manual is cheap IMO.  Its case and packaging appear to be recycled - as a demonstration of Sonys participation in the myth of climate change - so the tech stuff like �duo CPU and 8 mics� thing - gets a little drowned out.The folks at Bose use to piss everyone off in refusing to publish specs. They would reply �just give our speakers a listen�.  And to a large extent - I think that applies here.These headphones do have a very good frequency spectrum , SNR, and although I have not thoroughly tested it yet - Id bet the ANC works very well.The minimalist will love the flat black (or silver) shaved exterior.  The one little paper included in the box (besides ads and the warranty) is a safety sheet that only lists ALL the MANY THINGS you should NOT do with them.  Nothing is written inside to say how they can be used or enjoyed.You must download the �CONNECT� app, create an account, and use the phone app to set up and control the headphones. NOTHING is possible without doing that.  (One more tether to tie you to your phone).Of course you read the terms and agreement when you open your account too - (and they wouldnt dare use any of your PI, nor would your privacy ever be invaded).So I listened to the sound - and it is as good - perhaps a tiny bit better - than my Bose.But at a much higher cost - AND not until signing up & using the app to adjust the Sound. They are very lifeless without setting up the equalizer AND pushing the volume to FULL. This is a must.Im not sure they even have the volume output of the Bose.  That is a major concern to me due to my particular use - AND that I do like music to be fairly loud (and clear).Lastly, iPhone users - if you dont play the game of getting the latest iOs revisions, certain functionality may not be provided.  So iPhone users be sure to check on that.With such a price tag - and so many ties to endure - to gain and maintain full functionality with these, it may keep �fence sitters� like myself from returning them (after going through so much just to test them out).�Others� - who seem so thrilled - throwing 5 star reviews on everything they try, (and probably listening to compressed MP3 formats) will give Sony the goAhead on these.  But I am not so thrilled.  I like quality to be in all aspects of the equipment. And I like the USER to be in full control.There may be more to what Sony is getting here - than their customers.",3,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Anon,These headphones are awesome!,"I was hesitant to even consider these headphones because the idea of spending several hundred dollars for headphones seems outrageous.  However, I had the opportunity to try on someones AirPod Max and was blown away by the noise cancellation.  My work requires a lot of focus, and I find I am easily distracted by even the most subtle noises.. background talking, laptop fan spinning up, ambient noises, etc..  So I justified this purchase as a way to help me stay productive with work, and it absolutely has been delivering on that hope!  After researching the pros and cons of the different options in that general price range, I determined that these seemed like the best fit for me.  They are considerably lighter than the Max, and the noise cancellation at least as good, if not better than the Max.  The price, while still a lot of money, is also considerably cheaper than Max.  These are super comfortable for my ears, which was a relief because I am typically very sensitive to wearing any kind of over-ear headphones.  The battery life almost seems too good to be true (but its not - you really do get 30 hours on a charge), which is another big plus for me.  Ive read reviews saying the sound quality isnt quite on par with the Max, but I honestly cant tell the difference.  Im not an audiophile, but I do have a fair amount of experience with audio equipment, and I feel these do an excellent job.  The closest to any negative feedback I could give on these headphones is that Im not a fan of touch surface interfaces (touching the right ear-piece lets you pause/play with double taps, swipe left/right for next/prev track, and up/down for volume.  For my taste, touch interfaces are unnecessary and actually less intuitive/user-friendly than good old fashioned buttons, but thats just my opinion.  Also, double tapping to play/pause, no matter how softly I do it, kinda creates a very loud booming sound which I find unpleasant.  That said, I dont find I need to mess with those controls much anyways.  I am wearing them as I type this, and am so excited to have this ability to erase all background noise while I focus.  ��",5,B09XS7JWHH,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Conner Griffin,Amazing HeadphonesFor an android user,"I bought these headphones and completely fell in love with them only until I realized how incompatible they were if you werent a android userso much so, I ended up returning them because of my frustration and fatigue with its interface. If you use Apple products like I do, the headphones features like �360 audio� (which was a huge selling point for me) only works when you download an app for the headphones, and then again only works with certain apps and websites, not all audio like Apple Music or Spotify. I found this to be a huge let down and was even more annoyed I needed these myriad of apps to utilize a huge selling feature of the headphones.Besides the compatibly issue the headphones were amazing: great design, amazing audio, and great battery life yet, ultimately for me its overly complicated ways and hoops to jump through as an Apple user is what steered me away here.I instead bought the Apple AirPods Max, equally great sound quality, superior design, and elite performance, plus they are insanely and easily comparable with every thing Apple which was a huge selling point for me. Plus, their �spatial audio� (the same thing as �360 degree audio�) actually works seamlessly, which numerous apps, without jumping through hoops.(Also random tidbitthe Sony headphones get extremely hot and sweaty after you wear them for too long.

It's pretty amazing what they can do without user input in the way of adjusting the ANC based on location and activity and stuff, but still allowing user control over these settings.I loved my WH-1000XM4s, not so much my WF-1000XM4s, these are simply a step above (at least) any other headphones I've used as far as daily use headphones go. Light on the head, don't get hot, don't make my head hurt, and finally someone at Sony figured out that it's not worth allowing the headphones to fold just to be a bit more compact.

Im constantly having to readjust them every time I put them on. Also, the cushion that sits on top of your head is thinner on this newer model. This has caused an annoying feeling after a few hours of wearing on top of my head. Didnt have any of these issues with my XM4s. What are you doing Sony design team??? Did you guys not test these out day to day use before releasing?I would not suggest buying these if you have the previous model because it is a BIG downgrade. The design flaws are not worth the slightly better noise cancellation.Unfortunately I sold my old pair before receiving this new pair so Im kind of stuck with them.

Dennis,"Great sound, but several issues make it a no-go for me. Sticking with my Bose QC 35 Series I","I have owned the Bose QC 35 series I (the originals) for four years now, and just recently replaced the ear pads since they finally deteriorated. I figured after four years there has to be some serious improvements in noise cancelling technology, and since the WH-1000XM3 model got so many good reviews I figured these would be awesome. So I pre-ordered them.I pulled them out of the box and followed the very quick connect process of downloading the app and using it to pair to my phone. It downloaded a firmware update automatically while I fiddled around with some settings briefly and listened to some music. Super easy, awesome.The sound is very impressive. Punchy kick drum (I listen mostly to rock/metal) and nice bright sound. I quickly settled on a slightly customized version of the included Bright preset.But things quickly went downhill from there.After using the headphones for a bit, the touch controls became frankly annoying and easily susceptible to mistakes (I triggered track skips multiple times just by removing and putting the headphones back on). The volume adjustment is especially tedious...if you want to raise or lower the volume significantly you have to swipe it up or down a large number of times because the volume adjustment is done in small increments. With the Bose QC 35 and its dedicated buttons, you just quickly push the buttons. Simple.I spent about 20 minutes trying to figure out how to pair the headphones with my laptop, reading the guide in the app and doing some web searching, thinking it must be provided by one of the two dedicated buttons like on the Bose QE 35s. Nope. It must be done with the app. In fact, everything has to be done with the app except whatever you have the custom button configured to do, and the power. On the Bose I just have to slide the power button, and it goes into pairing mode. Simple.The above are honestly smaller issues that you could probably put up with since the sound these produce is so good. However, the deal breaker for me was when I connected them with the included wire to the controller on my Roku Ultra to enjoy some TV time after a long day. I always watch movies and TV with headphones. To my horror they produced a clearly audible hissing sound that is incredibly distracting. I turned them off and on again, disconnected and reconnected the cable. No change, still the hissing sound. My Bose don't produce this sound. Ugh.After listening to them for a couple hours I had a slight headache and felt fatigued, almost nauseous. I know some people are affected differently by the noise cancelling technology, but I don't get this from my Bose, even after listening to them all day.Additionally, speaking of noise cancelling, I compared my Bose QC 35s to these, and I couldn't tell the difference between the noise cancelling. They sound the same to me. :shrug: I'm sure you could tell the difference with laboratory equipment though.All-in-all the sound these produce is really good, and the noise cancelling is great (although I can't tell the difference from my Bose QC 35 Series I). But they have 1) lots of annoyances in the touch controls instead of dedicated buttons, 2) the fact that the app is required to do everything (including pairing) except turning them off and activating the custom button, 3) the hissing on the wired connection to my Roku Ultra, and 4) the fatiguing after listening to them.I'll be returning them.",2,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
H. Akan,What have I done to deserve this?,"I have one of the oldest versions of these headphones. As I am a wage slave there was no justification for splurging on a headphone of this price range when I bought this. I do not recall the thought process that went into the initial purchase decision. (I suspect no thought went into it. But let's not dwell on the mistakes of the past impede us...)I am a product of the western education; as a result, I am a nihilist. As such, life has very little to offer other than sex, food and displaying superiority over my fellow men with the hope of getting more of the former two.Last week, as I was feeling especially oppressed by the thoughts of existentialist angst, I felt a sudden urge of something missing in my life, perhaps goaded by the Prime Day Sale on Amazon. So I decided to buy a newer (nay, the newest) version of the headphones, compounding my earlier folly.I, like many before me, made the assumption that if something is newer it ought to be better. I have found that this headphone shows no distinct superiority over it's predecessors excepting being shinier and more expensive. In fact, my older version of the headphone is better in terms of built quality and response time.If you are a like me: That is, a fool who hasn't got $300 to waste but in possession of the earlier version of these headphones.

Waiting for xm4 cant be more painful.Now coming to reviewANC: i felt no difference compared to xm3, they block the rumble of fans, coolers and pump set but are unable to block the voice of people talking(irritating voice of arnab goswami). They didnt even changed xm4s pressure inside the cans after anc is enabled. I still get the same headaches.Audio quality: not going to write like pretentious audiophile. These headphone are quite versatile if you are bass head then sony has it covered for you (which most of the people like here), bass was way overpowering for me on full setting but i dont like bass at all. I mostly listen to linkin park, so i set base level at -4 and equaliser on bright preset. This is by far the best audio product i have ever used.Audio quality wise here is my ranking.SM es 18<Creative ep830<SM e10s<Fiio f9 pro<one more triple driver<xm3<xm4.Battery life: I was doing burn in procedure of these headphones, so i kept headphones at max possible volume, so you may get better battery life. I got 18 hr of battery life with anc on. After unboxing battery went down from 100 to 60 in a 10 min and i was afraid that i got faulty unit but thank god a full charge fixed it.Comfort:Ear cups are bigger than xm3s and hence more comfortable too. After walking with them for half an hour on roof my ear got all sweaty.Multipoint connection: Works flawlessly, although switching music from one device to another is bit erratic.Audio lag: I also connected it to airtel xtream box and watched a complete episode of boys with no lag at all.Speak to talk: still prefer the old put you hand on right ear cup.Pause when headphone taken off: work 8 out of 10 times.360 deg reality audio: sony has give 3 months of free subscription of nugs.net but difference was not deal breaker.Accessories: you get 3.5 mm male cable from both sides, thank you sony for that. Charging cable is really short i mean really. You can use the provide cable just with power bank or laptop. You also get airplane adapter and carry bag too.Sorry forgot about micMic: It is better than my iPhone 11 pro, my friend used to complain a lot about low volume from my side but with xm4 they had no problem talking to me.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
PixelPixel,"Comfort, noise canceling, and quality. UPDATE 13 Nov 2020","Download Sony Headphone Connect App, open box, turn on headphones (bottom of left headphone on/off switch), using Sony Connect App, connect and paired new headphones.- My headphones were 100% charged out of box.- Many features in Sony Connect App, matter of your preference and use. I do think the app is solid and useful for my use of these headphones.- My headphones firmware updated automatically -be patient, process took several minutes. Initial impression; very comfortable, really good noise canceling and sound quality.- Voice clarity on both ends is outstanding.- Easily connected two iPhones,  my experience switching between them was seamless.- Used ear profile in-app feature to analyze my ear shape for 360 Reality Audio setup.- Able to connect to MacBook Pro (2020 version) directly via Bluetooth with no issues.UPDATE:  >30 hours of iPhone X, 8, and Bluetooth MacBook Pro connection.- The phone call quality is awesome (you can hear- No video lag/latency on FT and Zoom calls.-  I have found the connection at times can be a bit cumbersome when having two devices connected and receiving calls, it might be a setting or how I am picking up the call --directly from the phone or double-tapping on the headset.- Great noise suppression to the wind, outside city/road-noise, etc... No reported issues with other people on calls with me. Always told call quality was very crisp and clear...  my experience, much better than Apple Airpod Pro for suppression of noise for callers on the other end.- I have also now used these headphones for Bluetooth connection to Nvidia Shield connected to my TV for over 16 hrs. Easy direct connection directly from Nvidia Bluetooth Settings.  TV and Movie surround sound is great, you can hear the slightest sounds.Bose 700 vs. Sony WH-1000XM4- Seamless connection - prefer SONY- Comfort - prefer Sony- Headphone sound controls - prefer Bose. Sony touch control works ok but the Bose increase/decrease volume seems to work better on Sony- Noise-canceling for me, both performed in a similar way- Call quality, for me, both performed in a similar wayI Will continue to test and use Bose but the feel of the headset on my head is not as comfortable as Sony.UPDATE: Running 7.3 Update- Not sure if related but the initial bluetooth connection and subsequent connections are problematic;- I have had to reconnect several times via the app and my phone needs to be very close to the headset;- Once I am connected it has worked but I have had to repeat the process a few times now;- Additionally, after significant use, the touch controls are a nice feature but not ideal under some circumstances. For example, if you have a hoodie on, jacket with hood, etc... touch control is sensitive and fabric, cord, ect... will effect the touch controls.- I am running iphone X with latest iOS, should be receiving iphone 12 Pro this eve and will update with any new  comments.UPDATE April 2020: been using these headphones for several months now. Running and walking are great however, the Touch Sensor Control is not ideal for me, especially when using while exercising. I find the controls/sensor unforgiving and one misstep can restart a song and or podcast, other than they continue to work very well.Used these headphones for a extended 12+ hrs flight and another 9 hour flight.. great noise canceling and sound. Hooked up directly to Qatar Qsuite entertainment system with provided cable, sound quality was excellent.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
ohhimark,SOOOO happy with my decision,"So I was stuck between last year's M3 and the Bose 700. I saw these were coming out and wasn't sure. I did more research and was leaning towards the 700's to save money. I am primarily using these for WFH (music/calls) and the mic on the 700's is said to be amazing. As I researched I googled around and found that Bose has been having weeks of software issues and didn't want to get into that. I almost pre-ordered the M4's but decided to sleep on it because it didn't make a difference being in a queue. Finally one day, I found a YouTube video on the M4 and all my concerns were already addressed. I was sold.Yesterday (Aug 18th) these arrived at my door and I was on calls ALL DAY. They were perfect. Today, I get to enjoy music and silence �� HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Bros,Very good but still has flaws!,"Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Canceling Overhead Headphones with Mic for phone.PROS :1) Best noise cancelling on the current market Period in all frequencies.2) Sound quality incredibly balanced & adjustable with the App to individual taste3) Exceptionally comfortable, only beaten by the Bose 35s4) Excellent connectivity stable connection with 2 devices at once5) 30 hours battery lifeCONS:1) No AptX LL. This is a reason for me to send them back since I watch movies with head phones. In this day & age we need low latency to watch video content.This is unforgivable since Sony was notified in their previous version the WH-1000XM3 it was a must.2) Wind turns the ambient sound feature on & off. This is beyond annoying. Thank goodness it can be turned off3) If it's windy one can hear wind in a phone conversation. This is not a problem with the Bose 700s4) The ears will get quite warm if the headphones are worn for long periods.5) I'm still not a  fan of the swipe controls. They can be glitchy. For instance when trying to turn volume up or down, sometimes it pauses the music & other times it switches to the next track.Overall Sony has improved the WH-1000XM4 from the previous generation but it could be better, much better with a few tweaks & recommendations above to become the ultimate noise cancelling bluetooth headphones on the market.****EDIT**** I had to send the unit back because the automatic quick attention mode where human voices turn the music off went hay wire. Every sound started to turn the unit off. It didn't matter in the app if that feature was on or off, it kept doing it.  This is a major flaw in the design. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this model. It's frustrating beyond belief....Now I star",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
TayneTayne,Best headphones I've ever owned but -1 star for several minor usability issues,"As of about three years ago, I was an earbuds guy.  The wireless over-hear headphones I had tried previously never could approximate the kind of audio immersion you get when you wedge little speakers directly into your ear canals.  I never found over-hear headphone noise cancellation to work that well - often, turning it on would create more noise than it cancelled, compromising audio quality and, well, just sucking generally.  Not to mention the inconsistent and typically non-intuitive affordances for powering on/off, pairing, and controlling playback on these things.But then I picked up a pair of Sony's WH-H900N noise cancelling wireless headphones. I basically fell in love with them on day one and used the heck out of them over the past 3 years. So, now I'm an over-ear headphones guy.  Specifically, THIS line of over-ear headphones that Sony is putting out.I still love my H900Ns. But we all know that in tech a lot can change in 3 years time.  In fact, I was about to upgrade to the WH-1000XM3s a few months ago but held off after learning about the imminent release of the M4s. So I waited. Then I pre-ordered. Yesterday, I received them.I've now had about 24 hours to toy around with them and I'm already prepared to say that these are clearly the best headphones I've ever owned. Which is to say: They're everything I love about my WH-900Ns, but better:- They're noticeably lighter, and based on about 5 hours of use I'm convinced they're more comfortable to wear- Sound quality is significantly better. I didn't actually expect this amount of improvement, but it's definitely noticeable at both low and high end. Separation of layers is particularly amazing: vocals shine with total clarity, heavy bass tracks shake and vibrate my skull without any noticeable distortion; high-hats and snares are crisp and clear. Very happy with this so far, which i should mention is just using the default settings with songs downloaded from Spotify. I'm looking forward to optimizing further with custom equalizer settings in the sound connect app.- Small thing but the semi-hardshell case with dedicated accessory storage (pictured) is really nice to have (900Ns just came with a bag...)- Clarity of phone calls - both input and output (i.e., the mic works well) - is excellent. This is key as I plan to use these to listen to music and take meetings while WFH for the foreseeable future. The 900Ns were also very good in this regard, but the ability to connect to both my work computer and my mobile device simultaneously will really help me out during the work week.CONNECTING TO TWO DEVICES SIMULTANEOUSLYOne of the issues is figuring out how to connect to these things to two devices at the same time. Given that this is a new and much-anticipated feature, I would have thought Sony would have thought to make it crystal clear to new users how to actually do this. Maybe I missed it, but I couldn't find instructions for how to do this. Here are the steps I discovered through trial and error that allowed me to simultaneously connect to both my iPhone and Mac Mini:1. You may have to enable the feature from within the Headphones mobile app. For me, it was disabled. See photo I uploaded showing the relevant part of the application.2. You need to first pair the headphones to each device separately before it is possible to connect to them simultaneously. As far as I can tell, there is no way to put the headphones in pairing mode when they're connected to a device.3. Then, when the headphones are connected to one of the devices, you should be able to connect your second device to the headphones using the second device's bluetooth preferences.4. If the second device successfully connects, you'll hear a voice notification through the headphones: ""Bluetooth device 2 connected"". You'll also see two devices listed under the ""Status"" tab of the Headphones Connect application.Not a big deal, but seems silly that something like the above wasn't just in Sony's own documentation.OTHER MINOR GRIEVANCES AND NITPICKSIt seems that the only way to get the most out of these is to use them with your Android or iOS device. This is because a lot of functionality - such as the ability to customize sound - is only available on iOS/Android devices with the Sony Headphones Connect application. The iOS app is decidedly intended for use on iPhones - it only runs in portrait orientation, making it a pain to use on my iPad (which I almost always use in landscape orientation). But the worst thing about this is that I can't customize anything when listening on a MacOS device, which these days is a lot of the time. Fortunately, these sound excellent even with the default settings - just wish the capabilities of these headphones wasn't dependent on which device I was using them with.Final minor grievance (for now) is this adaptive sound control feature that Sony got me to try out. It requires location sharing and by default fires annoying and surprisingly frequent notifications on my iPhone about how it's apparently adapting to my ambient environment. I figured out how to mute the notifications but still need to figure out how to shut the feature off entirely, which I frankly have had enough of. My advice is to opt out of this feature when you first set your headphones up. Very disruptive with totally unclear benefits.FINAL WORD (FOR NOW)Again, best headphones I've ever owned, and I'm very happy with my purchase. But the minor issues I describe above, combined with the high cost of these things, were enough to knock a star off my rating. Buyer beware :)",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Abe Link,Microphones useless for Zoom/Teams/WebEx/Skype/Phone callls,"I wanted to replace my old Bose in-ear noise cancelling headphones with something more comfortable and that works better. I spent hours reading reviews, and settlled on the Sony WH-1000XM4.When I received it, I was amazed how good everything sounded through them, and how well the noise cancelling worked. And they were comfortable to boot!However, the next day I did my first Zoom call, and a colleague told me that I sounded like I was in a tunnel, and that he couldn't make out what I was saying. I switched to my old Bose set, and everything was fine.That evening, i called Sony support. I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with the very nice support person, including making calls from my phone vs my computer, resetting the headphones, etc, etc. It didn't help. He denied that he had heard of microphone problems before. He asked that I send the headphones to Sony for a replacement, thinking that they were a lemon, but I told him I'd rather just return them to Amazon. Which I did. requesting an identical replacement.A day later I had the new ones. And there was the same problem of poor mic quality, with weird static-like sounds and muffling. At this point, I decided to solve the problem. I tried the following, using recordings of Zoom calls to monitor the quality:1) Single vs dual bluetooth connectivity.2) Different microphone volume settings.3) Different degrees of noise cancellation (including none at all).And probably a couple that I am forgetting.Nothing helped the poor mic quality. I then really searched the web, and found out that although there are plenty of wonderful reviews, hidden in the reviews where the mic is used are clear examples of problems with the microphone.I then called Amazon to request another return, but used the microphone from the headphones, and then switched to my phone. The representative could hear the difference easily, and said she had trouble understanding me when I used the headphones.So I am giving up, and will buy a different brand. I am writing this long review to spare my fellow Amazonites who need to use a microphone the pain of having to return items.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
TechPicky,"Excellent noise cancelling, bluetooth range, sound very good, comfortable, horrible user controls","A disclaimer: I received this product as part of Amazons Vine program.  While I didnt pay for the item, the review is totally my personal, unbiased review.  Neither Amazon, nor the vendor has influenced this review in any way.ProsExcellent noise cancellingVery good sound quality for all Bluetooth profiles (Listening to music, phone/video calls)Battery lifeExcellent Bluetooth rangeAutomatic voice detection to pause music and enter transparency modeConsTouch controls are simply awful!Dual Bluetooth device supportConstant beeps and noise cancelling turned off especially with �Detection of Actions� enabledVoice detection for stopping music and going into a transparency mode responds to almost any sound you make.  A large breath, grunt, anything will trigger this feature.Rubs on the �helix� outer part of the ear on the left earSomewhat complex set up processOverall these are really excellent Bluetooth headphones.  The noise cancellation is absolutely excellent.  This is probably the best noise-cancelling headphone available.  The Bluetooth range is also exceptional.  Audio quality for music is also very good, and I expect most people will find them to be excellent. Phone/video call audio is also good receiving, and acceptable for the microphone.  They have long battery life and charge quickly.  They are relatively comfortable as well. The touch user controls are simply dreadful.  There are many other features with a range of benefit.Comfort:They seem comfortable, and the ear pads are soft and plush.  However after several hours the outside of my ears start to hurt from rubbing on the insides of the headphones (the area called helix on top of the ear rubs on the inside of the left ear around optical sensor area.)  If at sometime we resume taking long international flights this could be an even larger issue.They are still comfortable though when wearing them with glasses.  They ear pads are pliant enough to continue to make a good seal without painfully pushing them into your head.Bluetooth, Pairing, Multiple devices:These support 2 Bluetooth devices to be connected simultaneously.  The Bose QC35 has had this feature for some time.  I initially paired my iPhone X with the headphones.  I then added a MacBook Pro from within the Connect app.  I was then able to play music from the MacBook.  I went back to the iPhone and tried to play something.  It didnt immediately play. In fact, it is rather finicky.  Sometimes starting something with audio on the iPhone will cause audio to switch.  Mostly it doesnt if something is playing already on one device.  Stopping the audio, waiting, and then starting the audio on the phone is a bit more reliable. Even if the source on one device is paused and not playing it may not switch back.This is a bit problematic though since the iPhone still thinks it is connected to a Bluetooth headphone, so the audio is still routed to the Sony WH-1000MX4, but isnt played � so it goes no where.  This works far more seamlessly on the Bose QC35.  I actually found myself disabling this feature half the time.While the WH-1000MX4 does have voice announcements, it doesnt speak the name of the device.  It will say �Bluetooth device 1 connected,� whereas the Bose QC35 will speak �Joes iPhone.� Even more confusing is that device 1 and device 2 doesnt always refer to the same device.  Sometimes my iPhone is device 1 and other times it is device 2.  The only way to really know is to go into the app where it will identify the device associated with device 1 and device 2.I added a 3rd Bluetooth device, again from the app.  This works, but will disconnect one of the 2 already connected devices.  It works pretty much like most Bluetooth devices.  You disconnect at least one of the currently connected devices and then connect the new device.  You can have multiple devices paired, but a maximum of 2 devices currently connected.  You can see the list of devices within the Connect app.Bluetooth range is excellent.  It would easily stay connected when going from one area of a reasonably large house to another.  The range exceeds any other Bluetooth headphones.Sound Quality:Sound quality has to be the most subjective area to evaluate, yet one of the most important. Most people will find these really very good to excellent.  For most these may well be the best sounding headphones they have ever had. Those more critical may find a few areas where they lack, but still they are excellent for noise cancelling headphones.  Sound quality is probably one of the best aspects of these headphones.The sound quality when listening to high quality content was very enjoyable.  Overall they are fairly well balanced, albeit a bit heavy on the low end, but not boomy or with obvious peaks in the response.  More so they sound �warm.� The bass is noticeable, and quite deep.  You will clearly hear the thump of a drum, but still somewhat tight.  The deep bass on some of the Billie Eilish tracks is impressive. The bass is not so excessive though that it drowns out mid or high frequencies.  Music sounds good with individual instruments clearly identified.  Male and female vocals sound good and natural.The deep warm bass works well for movies and similar entertainment.  These will likely work quite well for watching airplane entertainment.  High frequencies are clear, and more smooth than harsh. They are balanced overall with a bit more low frequency emphasis that shifts the balance a bit.The iPhone app does have equalization settings, so it is possible to adjust to your personal preferences.  I reviewed these set at flat, default setting.If one is going to compare these to audiophile headphones they will clearly notice differences. They will not replace examples of the best open or closed back audiophile headphones.  They simply lack the detail, imaging and placement that those headphones present when paired with a quality DAC and headphone amplifier.  That really isnt a fair comparison though as these are noise cancelling Bluetooth headphones and they do a great job at that.I did listen through both Bluetooth with the AAC codec and wired with a quality external DAC while listening to high resolution content streamed from Tidal through a Master Quality Authenticated DAC. They do sound better with the same content played through a wired DAC than Bluetooth.  The difference wasnt as much was expected. Sony did a good job with Bluetooth.  I also tried listening to them with the power off, as plain wired headphones.  They didnt sound that different, which is rather a good thing.  The same experiment with Bose QC35s will have a totally different sound.  Bose relies extensively on equalization to get their otherwise somewhat poor sounding headphones to sound good.  Sony starts out with decent sounding drivers.I have not tried using the LDAC hi-resolution Bluetooth codec yet.  This isnt as easy as it would seem to use on either iOS or MacOS.  You cant simply use a high-resolution source to use it.  You need to download and install the Sony Music Center app, then load the high-resolution content into that app to play.  Im not sure how to get it to work with a Mac at all. The better codec should sound better.  To be fair, at least part of the problem is Apple in this case.I did try the DSEE Extreme feature.  This supposedly improves the sound quality of low bit rate compressed content.  I listened to some low bit rate MP3 files, and some standard streaming services, such as Amazon Prime music.  It sounded different, Im not sure I would say it sounded better.  At least what I noticed was a boost in high frequencies.  It made some of the squashed high frequency details more noticeable, but they still sounded highly compressed, and to some extent the compression artifacts became more noticeable.  This may well be a personal choice, and likely varies over content, level of compression, and codecs used.  The bottom line is that you really need to start with quality content.The 360 Reality Audio was a disappointment. I tried playing a variety of tracks in 360 Reality Audio on Tidal.  I did this using the Tidal app on both iPhone and a Mac. I did link the Tidal app with the Sony app as part of the initial setup.  I did notice a wider sound stage. It wasnt like demos in a movie theater for Dolby Atmos or anything that dramatic.  There was some front/rear placement depth.  It was interesting to play with for a while.  What I found though is that it just sounded strange.  I played some of the same tracks on Tidal HiFi or MQA and to me they sounded much better, much more musical.  Call me a purist, audiophile, or whatever, but I found the highly processed audio more annoying than enjoyable.  It doesnt replace the stereo imaging or placement that superb headphones can present as described above.  Honestly overall these sound good enough without these audio tricks.  Perhaps if there were some movie encoded with 360 Audio it would be better to enjoy special effects and less about musicality. It seems more of a gimmick than musical.  By far the best quality was the same song in Master Quality on Tidal with an external DAC and the 3.5mm wired cable.Phone callsThe audio quality on phone and video calls has been excellent on the receiving side and is about as good as Bluetooth HFP profile gets. it is excellent for conversations.  With the excellent noise cancellation these are excellent for long video calls.  They will likely continue to be great for those forced to endure a noisy open office environment, or need to make phone calls in a noisy area such as an airport or train station.Phone call microphone:Overall Ive had only a few complaints from those that Ive in meetings or on calls with.  Most people said I sounded fine.  I was on one phone call with my iPhone and the person had difficulty understanding me and could hear me fine when I switched to the iPhone.  They said I sounded �far away.�  On a video call I had some people refer to the sound as �bubbly.� After switching to AirPod Pros and the sound improved.They seem to isolate ambient noise reasonably well, although I havent had extreme cases to try during working from home due to COVID-19.  This is one area where Bose QC35 were awful. I dont know if they match AirPod Pro for microphone beam forming, but so far they seem fine. These work for phone and video calls, but arent great.Noise cancellationThese are fantastic at noise cancellation.  I havent been on an airplane with them, the real test, but these seem significantly better than the already excellent Bose QC35.  At least around the house they block out the low frequency sounds that noise-cancelling headphones are best at. Around the house even a Ninja blender was mostly attenuated while I was on a conference call.  My neighbors air conditioner that still can be heard with the Bose QC35 and AirPod Pros is completely gone with these.  I was even using a really loud flooring saw and used these.  I did still hear the saw, but not very loud, and I could still enjoy music while sawing flooring!  Family talking is mostly gone during conference calls and entirely when playing music.  I expect that these would be great in an open office environment or an airplane.  Bose QC35 were the best I had used prior to these, and the Bose dont work nearly as well, especially for voice.  They have much better noise cancellation than Apple Air Pod Pro buds too. If your main reason for looking for headphones is noise cancellation, these are what you buy.One annoyance I had with the Bose QC35 headphones is if I wore glasses the sidepieces would create an acoustic leak and let some noise in. They still work, but especially on an airplane you would hear more air noise. I havent tried them on an airplane yet due to covid, but so far I dont notice nearly as much difference as I did with the Bose with glasses.Battery:Sony claims 20 hours of battery life without defining what mode. Other headphones sometimes have decreased battery life with HFP (phone calls).  These definitely exceed the rated battery life.  With the first charge they lasted almost a week of varied use.  I used them for a multi-day virtual conference, and other meetings (combination of HFP and A2DP) for over 14 hours, and they still had 60% charge.  Sony doesnt specify any longer battery life with the wired cable.  On the Bose I would plug the cable in when I would go to sleep on international flights, and Bose quoted 40 hours like that, so 20 hours isnt fantastic.  It is more than enough though.  It will get you through the longest flight plus some other use.  Almost any other use it should be more than enough.  I used them over 10 hours straight one day and they were still around 70% charged.Charging:These charge with a USB-C connector.  They come with a very short (about 6�) USB-A to C cable but no power supply.  They charge relatively quickly (less than an hour from 20%, but I didnt time it).  You will need around a 10W power supply to get the fastest charging.  I monitored the charge current from 20% capacity.  They started at 0.44A or roughly 2.2W, which seemed reasonable for headphones. Then they jumped to 1.32A or about 6.66W, then to the maximum I saw was 1.8A or about 9 W! It is surprising that Sony pushed that much power into a headphone! The actually battery capacity has to be pretty large, so it apparently does use quite a bit of power.  In most cases this is of no issue, they charge up quick.  It can be an issue is if you are stuck trying to charge them in an airport or airplane port. They will also suck a lot out of a battery pack.User interface:This is the worst aspect of these headphones.  The touch controls are simply dreadful, almost unusable.  Simple buttons would have been much better.  Even with practice it is almost impossible to master the gestures to go forward, backward, start/stop, and change the volume. Either it doesnt register the touch, or it does the wrong thing.  You try and turn the volume down and track changes.  To be fair, they do have a volume control.  The Air Pods Pro dont and that is really annoying. Even with practice controls dont work right.Some guidance: to change the volume, especially lower it, swipe down on the right ear as if you are petting it. Just swiping as if using a smartphone touch screen wont work right.  Swipe down from above the top just like petting it, and then it might change the volume.  Changing tracks is even harder, and only seems to happen when trying to change the volume.  Hitting the start stop button doesnt seem to work, except of course when you try to adjust the headphone on your head and then it stops what you were listening to, and would likely hang up a call � be careful of that.  I end up using controls on my phone or computer most times.  Simple buttons would have been SO much better.Voice assistant:Setting up Alexa is not all that easy. Assuming the headphones are already set for Alexa, you already have the Alexa app installed and set up, and the headphones are already paired to the phone you still need to add the WH1000MX4 to Alexa. This takes going to the Alexa app, and adding the device.  It will then want to pair with Bluetooth.  I put the WH1000MX4 into pairing mode by using the almost hidden mode of holding the power button (rather than the app). It then showed it failed to connect, but it actually seemed to pair on the second attempt.  If you were successful you will have a second pairing of the device as LE_-WH1000XM4, for a second Bluetooth Low Energy pairing.Then Alexa did work hands free (if enabled in the Alexa app).  You could just say Alexa and it worked.  You could ask Alexa what ever you normally would.  It seemed to actually work better than the Echo Auto that also relies on the app.  The response audio always has the first syllable of cut off though.  This works fine for querying Alexa, or invoking Alexa content.  It does NOT work for controlling other functions on the phone, even changing the volume.  Telling Alexa to play wont resume what was playing on the phone, it will resume what the Alexa app used last it seems.  This may be iPhone limitations, but I will likely switch to Siri and see if that works better.  It would be great if you could have all of them and just invoke the desired one with the appropriate wake word (Alexa, Hey Siri, OK Google).  I havent tried other voice assistants with these yet.The automatic speak to chat feature is both great and annoying.  At least with the sensitivity set to automatic it will detect voice quite well and stop the content you may be listening to, and allow ambient sound to be heard.  This, when desired is far more convenient than Air Pods Pro where you have to hold be button for a few seconds to go into transparency mode.  While you still cant hear what someone says to you, at least when you reply to them, it immediately lets you hear them, and doesnt take the seconds the Air Pods do. With AirPods you also need 2 actions to stop music and enter transparency mode.  This mostly works.  In the automatic mode it doesnt need to actually be voice that triggers it.  Anything like a grunt, large breath, anything it seems will trigger it. The slightest grunt or sound and they stopped the music and went into ambient mode.  There is a low sensitivity mode that I havent tried yet.  You will find this feature to be a love/hate relationship after a while.  Even with the �Focus on Voice� feature enabled this still seems to be overly sensitive.Another feature is adaptive sound control.  This is supposed to optimize the sound based on location, and detection of actions.  This is likely useful when changing between an office, train station, etc.  I havent evaluated that during a pandemic.As for automatic detection of actions, that can be very annoying.  It was fine when sitting in one place. Initially I didnt know why EVERY time I bent down the headphones would beep and go out of noise cancelling mode. Then resume playing normally. This is apparently the notification for detection of actions.  This can be disabled in the app.  If someone were to use these headphones in a gym or exercising this would be annoying as well.  (Note: These are NOT sport headphones!) AppThe app is essential to setting up, using, adjusting, and updating the headphones.  Sony even uses the app for pairing with the iPhone, which is unusual.  The app allows configuring the many options available, equalization and more.  You also use the app to optimize the headphones for the shape of your ears by taking a picture of your head and both ears.  I went through the whole process.There are a lot of options in the app, and the layout is OK.  It can be a bit confusing.The app does provide a lot of control and information.  It shows battery level, and the current codec in use.  This last part I really like, Apple typically doesnt show these details.  Many options can beyond simply being enabled or disabled from the app can also be further controlled.Case, accessoriesA nice rigid fabric coated and lined travel case is provided. It is similar in size to the Bose QC35.  It appears that it would protect the headphones and hold up well with travel.A 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable is included. This allows using the headphones with a wired source, such as an airplane entertainment system.  The cable does not have a microphone or controls and will not control and iPhone, iPad, or Mac or support calling.  It is only a 3-conductor plug for stereo listening.While the Bose QC35 headphones come with an equivalent cable, the Bose QC25 cable, or the Amazon Basics alternative cable can be purchased that does allow using the QC35 for phone calls, and wired remote.Also included is a short USB-A to USB-C charge cable, no charger, and the old 2-pin airplane adapter.",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Sim�o Sim�o ,Os 10 tpicos que queria ter visto em uma avalia��o,"CONSTRU��O 10/10� de pl�stico duro de muita qualidade, tem um toque meio aveludado, o preto  fosco e passa bastante robustez.CONFORTO 8.5/10� acolchoado na parte superior que encosta na cabe�a e isso  muito agrad�vel. As almofadas da orelha s�o muito macias e de couro sinttico, mas gostaria que fossem mais preenchidas, parecem meio finas. Minhas orelhas n�o encostam na almofada e se encaixam totalmente dentro delas, o que  timo. Se uso mais de 50 min elas esquentam e, as vezes, ficam um pouco doloridas, mas se tirar 5 minutos j� passa e voltam ao normal.SOM 9/10� de muita qualidade, a nitidez e a capacidade de atingir graves e agudos  excelente. Contudo, n�o gostei da calibragem de som original do fone e isso me frustou bastante no in�cio. Minha felicidade foi descobrir que o fone se adapta MUITO bem � equaliza��o. Sempre usei o equalizador no Spotify porque tenho um gosto muito espec�fico de som e, mesclando ele junto com o equalizador do aplicativo do fone, cheguei a um som que me agrada bastante. E foi de quebra bem legal ver que, se eu quiser, posso focar diferentes tipos de som (graves, agudos, mdios, vozes�) que ressaltam diferentes partes das msicas apenas com a calibragem do equalizador.VOLUME 8/10Confesso que eu esperava que o fone fosse capaz de atingir volumes mais altos. � bom, e o isolamento de ru�do permite maior qualidade e imers�o em volumes mais baixos. Mas teve momentos em que gostaria que ele fosse capaz de subir s mais uns 15% no volume. Desde o volume zero ao cem confesso que fiquei impressionado porque n�o percebi nenhuma perda de qualidade ou nitidez no som.BATERIA 7/10S dei 7 porque foi anunciado 30 h e consegui zera-la em 15. Particularmente eu acho 15 horas uma autonomia bem respeit�vel, s  beeeem diferente do anunciado� Dentre os diferentes usos que j� fiz eu consegui entre 15 e 27 horas de autonomia, ficando numa mdia de 20/22 h de autonomia por recarga (que fa�o de uma a duas vezes na semana durante a noite).CANCELAMENTO DE RU�DO 7.5/10Pol�mica. Eu nunca tinha usado um fone com cancelamento de ru�do antes e alm do receio de n�o ser bom eu n�o tinha ideia do que esperar j� que n�o tinha nenhuma experi�ncia prvia pra comparar. Achei interessante, mas nada de extraordin�rio. Ajuda BASTANTE no conforto acstico mas deixar passar barulhos externos sim. Tem um pessoal muito pessimista e outros muito otimistas fazendo avalia��es, ou ama o fone ou odeia, e eu, particularmente, prefiro os realistas. Olha, pra ru�dos baixos e repetitivos como ar condicionado, ventilador, metr�, avi�o (etc)  simplesmente sinistro como o fone  capaz de tirar praticamente 90% (de vez em quando 100%) do barulho,  como entrar numa realidade paralela. Eu uso pra estudar, sem msica e s com o cancelamento de ru�do ligado e escuto o meus colegas virando a folha do caderno, batendo o l�pis, cochichando, mas isso  ru�do de fundo, como se esses barulhos perdessem de 60% a 80% do volume e, dependendo da minha concentra��o,  como se nem estivessem l�. De vez em quando rola uma press�o no ouvido assim que ligo o fone, mas rapidinho eu acostumo e n�o me incomoda. A redu��o de barulhos ajuda MUITO na qualidade e clareza do som quando voc� t� ouvindo msica. No app tem como otimizar o cancelamento fazendo uma an�lise do ambiente e da press�o atmosfrica de onde voc� t� e  impressionante como isso ajuda na qualidade do isolamento em diferentes situa��es. Minha conclus�o  que ajuda muito, de fato tira muitos barulhos do ambiente e reduzem muito o volume de outros, mas n�o  100% n�o.ENTREGA 10/10Comprei numa quarta feira e chegou, literalmente, na quarta-feira seguinte. Fiquei impressionado com a rapidez de importa��o e da clareza com o transporte pela empresa que enviou. Moro numa capital e isso deve ter colaborado pra ter chegado r�pido, mas mesmo assim, atravessou meio mundo em uma semana kkkkCONTROLES e TECNOLOGIA 7/10� tudo touch, volume, pausar, pular ou voltar uma msica. N�o achei particularmente intuitivo e muitas vezes vou fazer um comando e acontece outro. Preferiria muito mais se esses controles fossem em um bot�o f�sico como no Bose. Algumas funcionalidades n�o precisam de �atualiza��o�, um bot�o f�sico seria bem mais pr�tico que ficar esfregando o dedo na concha e tentar acertar o gesto� O modo transpar�ncia  interessante, mas n�o uso porque acho muito mais pr�tico e eficiente (e menos rude) tirar o fone pra prestar aten��o em algo. Tem uma fun��o que, ao tirar o fone, ele automaticamente pausa a msica e, ao recolocar na cabe�a, ele automaticamente reinicia a msica,  uma funcionalidade incr�vel e eu adorei como ela funciona bem. Alm do mais, se voc� deixar o fone fora da cabe�a por alguns minutos ele logo desliga, automaticamente, e n�o gasta bateria atoa, o que  timo!CUSTO BENEF�CIO 6/10Vale o pre�o original? N�o. Eu comprei numa promo��o de 25% o que, ainda assim, acho que estava mais caro pro que esse tanto de tecnologia de facto vale. Acho que  um fone que valeria pagar no m�ximo 1.500 reais mas, nessa faixa de pre�o, N�O existe no mercado qualidade de som, bateria, e cancelamento de ru�do � altura desse. Estamos refm desse fone porque, para o tanto de tecnologia que ele oferece, ele , dentre os outros, o mais barato (se  que se pode chamar isso de barato�). Se for pra comprar, tente esperar uma promo��o. Quem rala igual ao brasileiro n�o merece pagar mais de 2.000 reais nesse fone n�o, d� valor ao seu dinheiro!CONCLUS�O 8/10Espero ter ajudado algum, quando fui comprar tinham avalia��es muito genricas ou cheias de opini�es ao invs de argumentos concretos sobre o produto. Quando o investimento  grande assim, quanto mais informa��o conseguir antes de comprar melhor. Particularmente gostei de comprar e n�o me arrependo, ter essa tecnologia toda um um fone  bem legal, MAS n�o acho que compraria de novo nessa faixa de pre�o n�o. Espero que fa�am uma boa decis�o!",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
BobHartleyGPSBobHartleyGPS,Buy this thing for noise cancelation!,"If you are looking for noise cancelation at its best, don't look elsewhere and buy this immediately.Of all the comments that have been said about being not enough this, not able to do that, I think they are all untrue or either an unlucky manufacturing defect. Launch products are not perfect from the start, it's bound to happen. The only thing I do not use are the microphones for making calls, so you can check online and see for yourself about that aspect.Let's break this down in points. (TLDR at the bottom)Comfort/Ergonomics:Without a doubt the most comfortable headphones I ever wore. People seem to complain that it's not as comfortable as the XM3s, I say it's pretty dang comfortable considering that I wore this thing for more than 5 hours straight and had no neck pain or itching whatsoever.The weight of these headphones is so light that when the box came in, I thought I had been scammed and the headphones weren't in the box. 250 ish grams is really light (0.55 pounds) for headphones.The ears are big enough, the line of the muffs doesn't overlap too much towards the neck and the cushion material adapts really well to your head, both on the top of the frame and on the ear muffs.Sound/frequency response:I have been mixing/mastering for multiple years on flat studio monitors. Out of all the headphones that I have or I have tried, these are the closest of being pretty much flat, once you cut 3-4 dB from the 400 Hz fader (pretty sure it's an octave bandwidth, or a little more, so it covers at least from 282 Hz to 566 Hz when you adjust it) on the equalizer in Sony's Headphones app.I have attached the frequency response curve as an image in this review.The bass is not overwhelming, (although if it's your style, it delivers with the clear bass knob, which probably covers 250 Hz and below), the highs are not too sharp and there's no spike in the high mids (2500-5000 Hz) or in the high end (above 5000 Hz).The only problem is the low mids at around 400 Hz, which thank god they have a fader for that frequency. No matter what brand you choose, low mids are ALWAYS a problem in headphones. By the way, sound separation is excellent once I made that adjustment. Thank Sony for giving you the option!The frequency response when using Bluetooth is between 15 Hz to 17 040 Hz. Beyond that, it starts to wane off. I have up to 19.1 kHz in my right ear and 18.3-18.4 kHz in my left ear, so it's not on my side. Considering that my phone has a terrible audio output (it cuts at 15 kHz), it's an upgrade for me.Also, considering on how many people listen to their music too loud for the last 25 years, I would be highly surprised that people that claim the high end isn't well defined actually know what they are talking about, and most probably don't notice the difference. Same thing with audio CODECS disappearing from the XM3 (the XM4 has 3 and the XM3 had 5), above 256 kbps at variable rate and 320 kbps at constant bit rate, you don't notice anything if the conversion was done right. Above those values, me and my friend call this ""Placebo Quality"". Compression and brickwalled mixes affect the quality perception GREATLY.Search NPR sound quality test online. It proves my point.So in conclusion, if the song you are listening sounds like garbage, it's because it was mixed/mastered like garbage (probably mixed nowadays because they brickwall often at this stage). These are hands down the best headphones I ever tried. Period. Including my Sennheisers that I used for multiple years.Noise cancelation:I was highly surprised at not only the sensation on your eardrum being pushed in not being super apparent compared to other models, which are quite frankly unbearable in the long run, but also the capabilities of phase canceling of these headphones (the actual term of canceling out waveforms is called phase canceling, noise canceling is a marketing term for people not familiar with audio, since the majority of people don't know what is phase).Transients (such as impacts) are impossible to isolate because they are too fast to sample and to invert the phase to create cancelation. Steady noises are the only ones that allow the headphones to sample them and invert them, because there's a processing delay. Stop hitting a table like someone I know was doing to test headphones, it's worthless.The amount that is being canceled out is out of this world compared to previous generations that I have tried. I can't wait to try them on a plane. High end will remain because it's the most difficult part of the waveform to cancel, since it's the most precise and the one that takes up the most information in a signal. I was standing next to a washing machine during its max spin cycle, could barely hear it with audio of people talking in my headphones. Without playback, you hear the high end when you're right in front of it. As soon as you close the door, it pretty much vanishes.If you have noisy neighbors or live in an apartment, buy this thing! You won't regret it.Battery life: Outlasts my cell phone by a hundred years. In 2 hours of use, not even 10% used. Specs are believable.In conclusion, buy this thing if you are looking for noise canceling!TLDR:-Super comfortable-Amazing in sound-Amazing in noise canceling and battery life matching specs",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Nikhil Ranjit,"As someone else in this review section said "" conditionally recommend""","Update sept 26Got the replacement set and they sound do much better than the first ones I recieved. This kind of issues is unheard of from a product that costs 30k not gonna lie. Seriosuly? A defective pair of headphones ? Unexpected sony !Update- sept-25So I was  using these like.usual when I started hearing a shrill noise from the right side earcup! Tried it with multiple devices , persistsnt shrill noise with noise cancelion and no music( my room's fan was off ) . Replacing for a new pair . Will updateI'm not a ""audiophile"" but I've tested and heard many headphones/earphones in search of the ""perfect"" pair of cans for me. Perfect is a subjective term and will vary from person to person.I bought these becasue of all the hype with the xm3's and as a customer the ""next"" version would obviously be better right ?So, come delivery day. I ooened these, set them up, updated the firmware and started listening . These sound , ok. For something that costs 30k, these sound average at best. The noice cancelling is good but I need to test it more , possibly on an airplane ( whenever that happens )When something is this expensive you automatically have some expectations from it right ? It has to perform at the 30k level ( I hope the reader is getting what I'm trying to say) .The software features are great , the build feels premium, the connection is strong.P.S if you intend to use the multipoint function you will loose audio quality . LDAC uses two lanes ( max for bluetooth 5.0) and when you use multipoint it switches to SBC ( 1 lane ) so expect quality loss. Windows doesn't support LDAC so you will loose significant quality when connected to a pc.I'll update the review after the burn in period . I won't be returning these since these are just too damn comfortable but doesn't justify the 30k price tag it demands for the sound quality I'm getting as of 20 sept.",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
A. Frazer,I will keep them... but they do not meet the outlandish reviews that I read,"Here's my honest review. I apologize if it's going to be long, or if I offend your own opinions.First, I'm not an audiophile. I usually listen to YouTube and Spotify on my Windows computer through a $50 pair of headphones. But I do know what excellent sound should sound like. My dad taught me that when I was young.Second, I never thought I would ever spend $350 on a pair of headphones. But with COVID-19 forcing me to work from home, I just can't function with the noise from the neighbor's landscapers (two neighbors, two interruptions per week) and another neighbor's yard construction going on. I stumbled upon multiple reviewers practically wetting their pants over how fantastic the NR in these headphones was. And since I'm always getting the headphone cord tangled up in my chair, I though I would go for high-end Bluetooth headphones.My review:These headphones are very comfortable. I don't understand how anyone could wear them for eight hours, and they're not as easy to wear as my $50 Plantronics headsets. But they are very lightweight for cans. I can wear these for 1-2 hours.I plugged them in with the uselessly short wire included in the box. That wasn't going to work. Then I added a 4"" extension cord. The sound, even through my Dell laptop or my HP tower was very good. They don't have the powerful bass that my $50 inside-the-ear-canal ear buds have. But for over-the-ear cans, they're pretty good.Next, I tried the noise reduction. After reading some of the glowing reviews I expected I would hear nothing but my heart beating. Sorry to disappoint you. The NR is very good. The NR is much better than the $300 Bose 3 headphones I tried 15 years ago and immediately returned for a refund. It does completely block out my neighbor's landscapers (yeah!) and my neighbor's construction (workers). And they even block out the annoying hum from my overhead lights and the annoying noise from my laptop fan. That was a pleasant surprise. But the reason I bought them for to block out the landscapers, so I am keeping them. But do they match the glowing reviews I read before I ordered them? No. They do not block out people's voices, of the TV set downstairs. I was hoping to use these when flying, instead of my inside-ear-canal ear buds. No chance. If you don't like to listen to people on your airplane yapping, stick with inexpensive ear buds.Last, I disconnected the wired connection and tried Bluetooth. It connected easily to my iPod, my Windows 10 PC, and my Windows 10 laptop. With Bluetooth, at best the sound quality is mediocre. It's about on-par with my $30 Plantronics headset when they are wired (although the Plantronics headset doesn't have NR). At worst, the sound with Bluetooth and Windows 10 is terrible. Sometimes it sounds like it coming through a flanger. The sound volume phases through either the volume swaying up and down, or the bass/treble is swaying up and down. I have not experienced this problem when connected through BT to my iPod. I saw on Reddit this is a known problem due to the limited CODEC's supported on Windows 10. The Reddit poster suggested plugging them back in through the wired connection. I did that, and they sound very good.So, my conclusion:For comfort I'd give them 8/10. For the price I expected them to be a bit more comfortable.Noise reduction: If you're sitting at your desk they're excellent at blocking out office/house noises: 10/10. But if you're on an airplane and want to block out people yapping away, or if you want to block out your coworkers yapping in the office, you might be disappointed: 3/10.Bluetooth connectivity. We expect it to be easy. That's the purpose of BT. 10/10Bluetooth sound quality with Windows 10. This is where they disappoint. I give them 4/10. And don't throw away the 1/8"" plug that comes in the box.  You will need it. You might not have this problem with an iPod, but there's no way I'm going to fiddle with a tiny iPod when I'm sitting at a desk.Value for the money: 8/10. They are very good (with a wired connection). But they do not live up the glowing reviews I read on the internet (yeah, what was I thinking).Andy FrazerI stand by everything I wrote here. Feel free to tell me if you disagree. I know I'm right :-)",3,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
avinashavinash,White/buzzing noise in the right ear cup when noise cancelling is enabled.,"The media could not be loaded.                 �I have been using these headphones for a month or so now, called Amazon to return this product just after 7 days (Amazon has a 7 day return policy deadline), Amazon, as you may have guessed refused to process my return/refund request and advised me to reach out to the local Sony service center, the service at this service center was horrendous to say the least - they were not able to diagnose the issue and when they did diagnose the issue they were unable to fix it, they got some help from a technical manager and found a temp fix by soft resetting the headphones or drivers which fixed the problem for a few days and low and behold the issue recurred after 4-5 days. The issue with this headphones is, when noise cancelling is enabled it starts producing a buzzing noise on the right ear cup which is very irritating and will not allow you to enjoy listening to music or audio books, this is a known issue with this product - even YouTube videos are made describing this same issue, I wonder why these MNC companies dare take advantage of Indian customers, maybe it is because of the lax consumer protection laws in our country.Absolutely disappointed with this industry leading noise cancelling BS product from Sony, they are apparently supposed to be the market leaders in music and sound systems. If any one is planning to buy premium headphones kindly do not consider buying this product. People kindly like or up vote this review so that others can take notice and steer clear from this dummy product. @Amazon you guys need to check the quality of the products you sell on your platform, there are YouTube videos describing the exact same issue that I am facing with these headphones, if I do not get a refund or if this white noise issue that I am facing is not resolved, I will most definitely sue both Sony and Amazon for selling a defective product knowing full well that it is definitely a defective product. Kindly feel free to reply to this review and ask me any questions to clarify your doubts.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
gg,Initial Impressions: They're good,"Update: (Mar 9, 2021)As someone mentioned above, I too started having tinnitus issues only after wearing these headphones. I was under impression that it might be due to cold weather or something else but it seems many people are facing similar issues with ANC headphones. I would also like to mention that I had COVID-19 earlier and tinnitus might be a post symptom from it.Initial 12hrs usage impressions: (Sep 20, 2020)Super comfortable.I am not an audiophile but these sounds amazing.ANC is great (tested indoors as of now).Dual device connection is also great.Great connection range.Speak to Chat works great but it has some obvious issues (something you need to get used to).Ambient Sound is also nice.Update:ANC cancels out the vehicular traffic sounds as well (horn sounds, movement), a bit dangerous considering you are planning to take a walk/run sideways. You can tweak the ANC settings via the Sony ANC app.Speak to chat can be finicky at times, there is a slight delay of 2secs. Sometimes it just fails to recognise and sometimes it gets triggered without speaking anything.My suggestion to buyers, don't go by the online reviews, it might be a good purchase for me but not for everyone. Try them out at some retail store before buying. I might update this when I have something more to share.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
ANUJ GUPTAANUJ GUPTA,"3 Months into use everyday, worth a purchase","I have been using these industry leading headphones by Sony, colour Midnight Blue, and trust me i find them worth every penny spent. Yes, i agree these headphones are highly expensive, some may say you can purchase Apple Airpods, Boss, Sennheiser, and other audio equipment options, but trust me nothing beats these bad boys.I am not a tech reviewer, but since being a musician, a music connoisseur myself and a huge fanatic of accessories such as headphones, earphones and smart gadgets, i can tell, these headphones are a revolution to the sound industry. I'll be quoting every pros and cons that i've personally come across and might help a few of you who decide to purchase this beauty.Pros:1. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): Let's talk about people who love listening to their music without any external interference while working, walking, running, working out, during a flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, ANC is a boon. Switch to ANC, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. Only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. Be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that ANC kicked in.2. 3 Ambience Sound Control (ASC) ON: Apart from the ANC, there are two more features that these bad boys offer.  ASC when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. This feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.3. Ambience Sound Control (ASC) OFF: When ASC is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the ASC is enabled. This feature is much similar to the ASC ON, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.4. Head Phones Connect by Sony: Let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by Sony under the name of Head Phones Connect. You can download it from the App store if you are an iPhone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.This app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. Once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.In addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.One feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the Speak-to-chat feature. It's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. This feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.For better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. This enables the device to perform better with distinct users.5. Motion Gestures: The right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. These controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.6. Number of devices that can be paired at once: These headphones provide an option of connecting two devices simultaneously. You can connect these headphones to almost every device that has a latest and updated version of bluetooth/NFC. Devices that i've paired them with are iPhone, macbook, hp laptop, and android phones.7. What's in the box: The box comes with an impressive in-shape carrying case to carry these bad boys where ever you go. Also they include a C-type data cable for charging, 3.5mm jack cable which is quite long (haven't measured it honestly, but it is as long as a regular data cable), and a dual port 3.5mm jack converter, which so far i haven't tested.8. Battery Life: Well i must say that i am quite impressed with the battery backup these headphones provide. This device completely charges within 3 hours and trust me with an ON/OFF mode of playing music regularly, the battery stays up till 4-5 days, which is i bet a highly impressive feature which probably no other company audio equipment in this range might have.9. Voice Assist Functions: These headphones can be connected to google assistant, SIRI and alexa and perform really well.10. Easy access keys: The headphones are enable with two easy access keys on the left earphone. The custom key toggles between the 3 modes that i've already mentioned above which are guided by the in-built assistant voice. The power key pressed long enough, turns ON/OFF the device and pressed once, the in-built assist provides you with the current % of the battery left.11. Comfort: I should had talked about it earlier, but never mind. With no questions asked these headphones are highly comfortable, the cushion provided is the softest pad your ears can get. Since i am regular spectacle user, i find it hard with headphones imposing excessive pressure over the ears, making it a painful experience, but these headphones give a feather touch to your ears, even if you are specy or even while wearing a face mask. These go good with everything.12. Battery Saver: These headphones tend to power-off on their own if not in use for more than a minute which is a highly power efficient feature added by Sony to the device.Cons:1. If you are into running or any sort of longer workouts, be prepared for sweaty ears. Since the cushions on these headphones completely cover you ears, creating a vacuum sort of environment, no air flows in and out, and the sweat starts dripping down from the earphones, which i must state doesn't affect them at all, only can be slightly irritating sometimes.2. ANC can be difficult to be kept enabled every time since it reduces the environment sounds to almost negligible, which can be dangerous while running or walking at a buss street. Be very careful while using this feature. Probably it is made for environments such as while travelling in a bus or a flight, and seems suitable for these environments.3. Since these headphones can be simultaneously be connected to two devices at once, which is a boon, but is also a slight problem in disguise. Imagine your headphones are connected with your laptop as well as you phone. You are attending an important zoom call while on your laptop and the headphones are in action, your phone starts to ring, now abruptly you'll start hearing you phones ringtone, and the device gets a little startled to which device shall be entertained. i've personally faced this, but i tend not to connect them to two devices at once.PS: One highly important thing is, you won't get an experience of the sound through reading review or watching Youtube videos. You might get a fair image of weather to invest in them or not, but you'll only get the sound experience when you'll listen the music through these bad boys.",5,B091CQH6VT,Colour: Blue,SONY,Headphones,
El kratos �,"Son nicamente para escuchar msica, para videojuegos o videollamadas no sirven.","Ahora por el home office estaba buscando unos auriculares de calidad para mis conferencias, jugar en la pc y escuchar msica, hab�a adquirido previamente unos Corsair Virtuosos los cuales son buenos con respecto a su microfono de lo mejor que he visto, pero la calidad para escuchar msica o videojuegos es mal�sima, suenan muy agudos y planos. Si deseas mayor detalle busca mi rese�a donde los comparo.Con respecto a estos sony, al ver las buenas opiniones que hab�a encontrado en muchos lados, dicen que son muy buenos en cuanto a calidad de sonido, pero para juegos no porque no trae el 7.1 ni mejoras de sonido espacial, tampoco para hacer llamadas porque su microfono es mal�simo, al parecer estan m�s orientados nicamente para escuchar msica. De hecho slo tiene soporte para Android y IOS, si decides usarlos en PC tendr�s muchos problemas como pasa con cualquier audifono de sony y no cuenta con un software ni soporte, yo tengo 4 auriculares sony y siempre dan problemas cuando quieres usar su microfono en windows, pero para escuchar slo msica son de lo mejor.Por eso debes definir bien para qu los quieres, no me atrev� a poner 5 estrellas pero tampoco 1, porque depende de tus necesidades, en mi caso quer�a para todo lo mencionado, pero al parecer no he podido encontrar nada en el mercado que lo tenga todo, algunos son buenos con el microfono pero psimos con el audio, otros alrevs. En este caso el microfono es un asco, lo m�s que podr�s hacer es contestar llamadas en tu celular en calidad pobre, busca en los foros de sony y ver�s cmo la gente se queja del microfono.Teniendo en mente que este producto es nicamente para escuchar msica desde tu celular, te describo sus opciones que son muy interesantes y en la mayor�a slo funcionan en celular, en pc no funcionan:-Son muy cmodos y ligeros.-Trae su estuche para guardarlos.-Requieres descargar la app para personalizar sus opciones, muy recomendable porque ver�s todo su potencial.-Bloquea el sonido exterior increiblemente, cuando te los pones sientes un vac�o por el bloqueo, como si estuvieras encerrado en un domo aunque tengas lentes, es una sensacin intensa y si nunca has usado un producto con bloqueo ambiental te sorprender�.-Se conecta por 2 alternativas, bluetooth o cable jack 3.5mm, incluye el cable jack y aparte un usb para cargar pero no trae la cajita, deber�s conseguirla aparte.-Compatible con Dolby Atmos y DTS, personalmente me gusta m�s Dolby. Las licencias deber�s adquirirlas aparte.-Trae un �rea touch en el auricular derecho y tiene varias opciones, doble toque pausa/reproduce, deslizar hacia arriba sube volumen, hacia abajo baja volumen, hacia el frente reproduce la siguiente cancin, hacia atr�s atrasa la cancin, si pones la mano completa desactivar� el bloqueo ambiental y activa los microfonos permitiendote escuchar el sonido exterior, reduciendo un poco el volumen de la msica. Al retirar la mano todo regresa a la normalidad.-Si hablas mientras escuchas msica, se detiene para permitirte escuchar el sonido exterior, esto puedes desactivarlo desde la app por si te gusta cantar las canciones. Es una funcin til si tienes muchas interrupciones de personas a tu alrededor.-Para algunas opciones escuchar�s una voz en ingls de confirmacin, puedes descargar el paquete de idioma desde la app para que lo escuches en espa�ol o en otros idiomas disponibles.-Usa el gps para saber tu ubicacin y en base a tu ubicacin puedes configurar las opciones, por ejemplo mientras vas en el transporte activar el bloqueo ambiental y si estas en casa desactivarlo.-Tiene equalizador con algunas opciones predefinidas, recomiendo probar todas.-Puedes emparejarlo con hasta dos dispositivos al mismo tiempo pero reduce la calidad del sonido.-Si te retiras los auriculares se pausa autom�ticamente la msica, cuando te los pongas regresa la msica.-Configuracin 360, te solicita tomar fotos de tu oreja para optimizar mejor el sonido.-Optimiza en base a la presin atmosfrica para realizar el vacio del bloqueo de sonido ambiental.-Materiales todo es pl�stico y las almohadillas son como de vinipiel, muy suaves por cierto, aunque si dan calor.-Duracin de la bater�a excelente, f�cil unas 30 horas.Espero no haber olvidado nada y tomes en cuenta cada elemento.En conclusin, si buscas unos auriculares con la mayor calidad de sonido del mercado, estos creo que son de lo mejor, el bloqueo de ruido ambiental es magn�fico algo nunca antes experimentado por mi, pero si quieres algo gamer o para conferencias, busca en otro lado, te recomendo unos HyperX Cloud flight, son de lo m�s equilibrado que hay a buen precio.Espero que mi rese�a te sea til.",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Ricardo ZavalaRicardo Zavala,�Excelentes aud�fonos!,"Estos aud�fonos realmente me han impresionado (para bien), yo vengo de unos Bose QC35 II, que aclaman ser los aud�fonos m�s cmodos de todos, y estos han superado mis expectativas (y creo que incluso superan al modelo anterior). No tengo una referencia clara con los XM3, por lo que la mayor�a de comparativa (comodidad, audio y aislamiento de ruido) para esta revisin ser� basado en QC35 II. Para que m�s o menos tengan un par�metro de comparacin.Voy a abordar la revisin en diversos puntos, y los ir desglosando, espero les sea de utilidad.- Construccin y materiales.Los materiales de construccin de estos aud�fonos son excelentes, la distribucin de su peso es bastante adecuada, tanto, que se �sienten� ligeros, aunque no sean los aud�fonos menos pesados de todos. Adem�s, se sienten resistentes y duraderos, en este apartado se ganan un 10.- Sonido.Partimos de la premisa que estos se tratan de unos aud�fonos inal�mbricos, por lo que se paga por muchas caracter�sticas, adem�s de la calidad de sonido. Adem�s, que el sonido, siempre es subjetivo y depender� de tus costumbres y exigencias en tus productos.Pude probar estos aud�fonos en diversos gneros musicales, desde rock hasta msica cl�sica, pasando por jazz y pop. La calidad de sonido es bastante agradable, tiene unos bajos muy buenos (sin ser sobre saturados, podr�a decir que son bajos muy n�tidos). Podr�a decirse que su sonido es un �V�. Bajos, medios, altos.Adem�s, soporta diferentes cdecs, lo que los hace bastante vers�tiles y muy buenos.Insisto, recordemos que son aud�fonos Bluetooth, y evidentemente no podr�amos compararlos directamente con aud�fonos del mismo precio sin el resto de las caracter�sticas que este posee, sin embargo, sin temor a equivocarme, podr�a decir que son los mejores aud�fonos Bluetooth que he probado.- Cancelacin de ruido.Excelente, no puedo decir mucho al respecto. Es la mejor cancelacin de ruido que he podido disfrutar.- Comodidad.Este punto es bastante subjetivo, por lo que puede ser un punto muy diverso en cuanto a opiniones. Desafortunadamente yo siempre he tenido problemas con aud�fonos de diadema, gorras, etctera (razn por la que decid� comprar los QC35 II, e incluso con estos ltimos he tenido algunos inconvenientes para largas sesiones). As� que en mi caso, quiz� sea un poco m�s exigente en este aspecto. Los aud�fonos, como mencionaba previamente, distribuyen su peso uniformemente, haciendo que se sienta �poca� presin sobre las orejas y la cabeza, sin tener esa sensacin desagradable de �vac�o�.  Las almohadillas son bastante amplias, as� que creo que es un punto muy bueno a remarcar. Son bastante cmodos en realidad.Si eres alguien que acostumbra a usar aud�fonos de diadema, estos aud�fonos son incre�blemente cmodos.Por otro lado, si no sueles utilizar este tipo de aud�fonos porque te cansan o sientes mucha presin, quiz� deber�as probarlos f�sicamente y estar con ellos un par de horas antes de tomar una decisin final.Pros:+ Excelente cancelacin de ruido activa (y pasiva tambin).+ Muy buena calidad de sonido (quiz� sea la mejor calidad de sonido inal�mbricos hoy por hoy. Son mejores que los Bose QC35 II).+ Muy cmodos, su distribucin de peso hace que sean muy cmodos de utilizar, sin que canse.+ La bater�a es muy duradera.+ Algunas caracter�sticas interesantes.+ Amplio soporte de cdecs y soporte de Bluetooth 5.0.Contras:-Su precio original puede ser algo elevado (aconsejar�a que los compren cuando encuentren una oferta).-Algunos controles t�ctiles dejan que desear.-La calidad de sus micrfonos para realizar llamadas, deja mucho que desear.�A quin se lo recomiendo?A aquellos que gusten de audio de buena calidad, inal�mbricos y que requieran cancelacin de ruido.Personas que suelen viajar mucho.Personas que gustan de concentrarse con msica o sin ella.Veredicto:�Sper recomendados!",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
FaTHoM,What world?,"After buying the WF-10000XM4's and losing the case (replacement is $150. I paid $225 ish for the set), I thought I'd give the WH's a try. I got them for $228 or so, so opted to not get the XM5's due to the price difference. I've only had them for barely a week, but my initial thoughts are certainly positive.Fit. Here's the deal, I have some big ears, with 3/4"" gauges. With my gauges in, I do get some pain in my neck. I have pain issues, so this was no surprise, nor is it a fault of the design. My ears fit fairly comfortably inside the cups to help lock out sound, minus the gauges. The polypropylene(?) material is quite soft and moldable, making wearing them for an hour or more easy and comfortable.I have a kinda funny shaped head (IMO. But I'm highly critical of myself and the world), but these look really slick placed on my dome. I got black, because black goes with everything, and I don't wear color. Look and fit much better than cans I've owned in the past.Noise cancelation. The ANC is good, but not great. I found the ANC on the WF's more thorough, which is a bit odd considering they're earbuds. However, they do form a more legit seal in the ear canal, so it could be that. There is some ""hissing"", but part of that is also my tinnitus. I find that there seems to be some slight hissing even with the ANC off. It's akin to being in a super silent room, and you hear the ""hissing"" from an AV system with it powered on, but with no sound. I've not flown with them yet (Which is a huge reason why I got these), but I assume they'll be just fine for passenger and engine noise.Sound quality. So, I'm pre-burn in on the drivers. There is usually 100 hours or so of burn in on every new speaker/driver on the planet, and these are no different (I have not researched this in actuality. I was in AV for several years, and have some knowledge). But, so far, they sound very pleasant and accurate. I opted for an EQ setting (Excited) just to bring out certain details in the instrumental/electronic music I'm currently listening to. You can hear the trilling of the tongue on a flute, and the fingers against guitar strings. The detail is fairly rich, while maintaining a fairly neutral overall tone. The sounds seem to be reproduced fairly accurately  and are fantastic for instrumenal music.For the price I paid, these are great. However, for the normal asking price of around $350, I expect the soundstage and sound field to be superior to what it is. It is evident that you are hearing music played through 2 speakers often times, instead of an amalgamation of speakers 180 degrees in front of you, or listening to a live performance where the sound comes from everywhere. Think of this as 3D sound if you will, similar to Dolby Atmos. I understand they have the real 3d audio whatever, but right out of the box, they should be fully immersive.Battery life/Bluetooth. Battery life seems to be ok with ANC on. I use ANC exclusively because I like to drown out reality while listening, especially during meditation. I suspect you could easily get 8 hours of consistent listening with ANC on before needing to recharge, which is plenty for half the flights on this side of the world (North America). What else can I say about battery life??Bluetooth connectivity is very strong and nearly instant. I can walk from my apartment to my neighbors apartment with my phone in my apartment and still have unbroken connectivity. THAT is freakin awesome.Overall, I'm very pleased with these cans, especially for the price I got them at. At the normal asking price, I'd recommend checking out the XM5's since their so similarly priced. If you're looking for a solid set of cans, and these are on sale, don't mess around, just buy them. You won't be disappointed.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Madhubala Tripathi,"Static noise problem just like XM3s, completely disappointing","Only after a day of usage, a constant static crackling sound started coming from the right earcup when ANC was on. This is the same infamous issue associated with the SONY XM3s. I never thought even after two years and so many complaints they would ignore the problem in XM3s, and the legacy still continues with the XM4s. Shame on Sony. Completely disgusting. Never expected such defects from such a pricy and premium product. It should not be 30K it should be 3K.",1,B0863FR3S9,Colour: Sliver,SONY,Headphones,
Omar Enrique Alvarez Arellano,La mejor rese�a jam�s hecha.,"Como alguien a quien le gusta sentir la msica en el interior (con otros modelos de auriculares), aprecio la calidad de los aud�fonos supra aurales, �Sony se ha ido y se ha solidificado en la cima de la monta�a con estos! Y sin duda vuelve a reinar sobre su reino sonoro como finales de los 80.En primer lugar, desde el primer momento, la facilidad de emparejarlos con mi telfono fue r�pida y sencilla con el uso de la aplicacin Headphones Connect de Sony. Hablar de calidad es tambin hablar de eficiencia. Lo nico que he querido durante un tiempo con los cascos es la capacidad de emparejarlos con varios dispositivos, que es exactamente lo que Sony ha hecho con estos y finalmente funcion como siempre hab�a so�ado.Todo se ejecuta a travs de la aplicacin desde la que simplemente eliges los dispositivos/auriculares con los que se emparejar� a fondo. Luego, para llegar a la comodidad en el uso diario, por alguna razn, estos se sent�an mucho m�s livianos que el modelo anterior que me comparti un amigo, as� que tuve que ir y mirar el peso de cada uno y me sorprendi descubrir que la diferencia era de slo 1 gramo, pero estos se sienten tan ligeros al usarlos sin sacrificar la comodidad en lo m�s m�nimo. Sony tambin pudo resaltar la calidad del sonido combinada con esta sensacin de peso m�s liviano, ya que la calidad del sonido sigue siendo de primera categor�a, por lo que f�cilmente los encuentras en casi todas las tiendas online como los aud�fonos m�s recomendados. Definitivamente una compra ineludible en estos d�as de promocionesY lo mejor de todo es que la calidad del sonido es incomparable. En una palabra: asombroso. Estos son, por mucho, superiores en cuanto a calidad de sonido en comparativa con sus contempor�neos, ya sea que se escuche msica, pel�culas o voces durante las llamadas. La msica suena como si estuvieras rodeado, sumergido en ella. El di�logo y los efectos de sonido en pel�culas o juegos y las conversaciones cuando se usan estos cascos durante llamadas o reuniones virtuales, son todos n�tidos, claros e inmersivos y no se nota ningn retraso.Desde bajos sper bajos y pesados hasta agudos cristalinos, y todo lo de en medio que slo un melmano puede entender, los XM4 lo ofrecen. Incluso desde el primer momento con una configuracin de ecualizacin plana, hacen que mi msica cobre vida. Cuando us la aplicacin complementaria Sony Headphones Connect disponible, pude ajustar mi experiencia de audio exactamente como me gusta.Soy un gran fan�tico de los graves y la mayor�a de los aud�fonos inal�mbricos no pueden reproducir el retumbar o el bajo pesado fuerte y duro que me gusta, especialmente cuando escucho rock y heavy metal. Pero estos manejan bajos extremadamente pesados sin distorsin en absoluto. Puede marcar tantas frecuencias graves, medias y altas como desee, utilizando ajustes de ecualizacin preestablecidos o personaliz�ndolos a sus propios valores espec�ficos. Incluso a volmenes altos, el audio es n�tido y nunca se distorsiona.La cancelacin de ruido es realmente la estrella aqu� tambin porque es simplemente lo mejor que he escuchado. Si bien todav�a usan el mismo procesador de cancelacin de ruido QN1 del modelo anterior, han actualizado el software y, junto con un nuevo sistema de audio Bluetooth en un chip, la cancelacin de ruido es incre�ble y realmente te sumerge en lo que est�s escuchando. Tambin admiten audio de alta resolucin y tienen una funcin llamada audio de realidad 360�, que crear� una experiencia de sonido envolvente utilizando una de las aplicaciones de audio compatible o pr�cticamente cualquier cancin con formato de audio de 8D que encuentres por ah� en internet.Otra novedad de los XM4 es algo llamado DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine). Junto con el nuevo software de inteligencia artificial, mejorar� la msica digital comprimida en formatos como el MP3 o AAC llenando ciertos huecos de forma que desconozco para brindar una experiencia m�s completa. Con todas estas nuevas mejoras, puedo notar una diferencia de calidad de audio entre el XM3 y el XM4.El otro elemento importante que cambia las reglas del juego con respecto al modelo anterior es la capacidad de los aud�fonos para detener la reproduccin cuando te los quitas y se reanudan cuando te los vuelves a poner. Esto es algo que se ve regularmente en los auriculares (como el WF-1000XM3), pero finalmente lo estamos obteniendo tambin con los aud�fonos de gama alta alrededor de la oreja. Esto tambin es extremadamente til ya que ni siquiera tengo que apagarlos m�s porque, cuando me los quito y los vuelvo a colocar en el estuche, estos se apagar�n autom�ticamente, aunque no la uso mucho porque me gusta ignorar a las personas que no respetan la msica que estoy escuchando, aunque cuando ten�a esa caracter�stica activada funcion exactamente como se anuncia, lo que supongo que es una consecuencia de la mayor cantidad de micrfonos comparado con modelos anteriores que tambin mejoraron maravillosamente la calidad de las llamadas y absorbieron ruidos molestos.Tambin quiero mencionar cu�n mejorada es la aplicacin porque siempre me molesta que, por cada par de auriculares, altavoces bluetooth o incluso si solo quiero cantar una cancin, se me recomienda descargar una aplicacin; Sony realmente ha ido m�s all� con su aplicacin, y esta es una que puedo seguir manteniendo en mi telfono, ya que hay numerosas funciones dentro de la aplicacin que realmente hacen que valga la pena conservarla ahora, sin olvidar que se actualiza cuando es necesario. Sin duda necesita una mejor puntuacin en Google Store.Hay una beneficio que me gusta que es 'speak to chat', que permite que los auriculares reconozcan cuando comienzas a hablar y apaguen cualquier cancelacin de ruido activa y cambien al sonido ambiental. La idea aqu� es que si empiezas a hablar, los aud�fonos suponen que est�s teniendo una conversacin y desactivar�n la cancelacin de ruido. He descubierto que, en condiciones ideales, esto funciona bien, pero si est�s en una situacin en la que puedes hacer una exclamacin o ruido o decir algo en voz alta, incluso cantar con msica, esto puede convertirse en una molestia, as� que dejo esta configuracin desactivada pero es bueno saber que est� ah�.Los aud�fonos an conservan muchas de las excelentes caracter�sticas del modelo anterior con la rid�cula duracin de la bater�a (30 horas) que en realidad coincide con todo lo que se anuncia: las funciones t�ctiles en el auricular derecho, Alexa y el asistente de Google incorporados y carga r�pida donde 10 minutos de carga te dan un par de horas de reproduccin. En general, podr�a escribir un ensayo sobre lo incre�bles que son estos auriculares, ya que amo las nuevas tecnolog�as de sonido y definitivamente puedo decir que est�n en la parte superior de mi lista de tecnolog�a de audio actual. Para aquellos que compren su primer par de aud�fonos supra aurales, quedar�n impresionados.Para aquellos que simplemente se actualizan desde el modelo anterior, perm�tanme decirles que las adiciones de deteccin de desgaste, el poder hablar y escuchar por chat fluidamente, conexin de mltiples dispositivos, la obra maestra que representa su calidad de audio en msica, juegos y pel�culas y el aumento de la comodidad general valen la pena la actualizacin en mi opinin. No s cmo Sony podr� superarlos, pero actualmente son due�os del mercado de los aud�fonos alrededor de la oreja.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Raul,"Excelente producto para usar con dispositivos mviles, pero no recomendables para usar con PC","Resumen:Si el presupuesto no es un problema, son unos excelentes aud�fonos para escuchar msica o disfrutar de contenidos en l�nea. No son tan recomendables si los piensas usar para atender llamadas o conferencias en l�nea desde una PC debido a ciertos problemas de conexin con Windows y la prdida de algunas funciones que solo est�n disponibles al usarlos con dispositivos Android o iOS compatibles con la aplicacin oficial de Sony.Ahora la versin extendida:La calidad de sonido es excelente, el ecualizador integrado en la aplicacin ayuda a sacarles el m�ximo provecho e incluso funcionan con ecualizadores de terceros. Sin embargo, estos ajustes solo funcionan cuando est�n conectados a algn dispositivo Android o iOS, al conectarlos a una PC se pierden y la calidad de sonido disminuye. Tampoco es que sea mala la calidad de sonido que ofrecen al conectarlos a una PC, pero la diferencia vs la conexin a un celular o tableta es notoria.Una de las funciones que promociona Sony es el audio 360. En mi experiencia esto no es nada de otro mundo, la oferta de este tipo de contenidos es muy limitada y cuando se trata de msica nicamente se escucha como si en un ecualizador usaras la opcin �Sala de conciertos� (yo los prob con Tidal).La cancelacin de ruido es extraordinaria, en vedad te a�slan del mundo exterior desde el momento en que te los pones. Usar la cancelacin de ruido sin msica puede ser un poco molesto ya que generan una sensacin de vac�o en los o�dos que llega a ser molesta. El modo ambiente tambin es bueno, aunque personalmente hubiera preferido una mayor sensibilidad de los micrfonos para permitir el paso de m�s sonido desde el exterior y de esa forma no perder ningn detalle.La bater�a tambin es muy buena, me han durado entre 3 y 4 d�as completos de trabajo (jornada de oficina) sin tener que recargarlos. Ayuda bastante que el puerto de carga sea USB tipo C ya que puedes usar el cargador de tu celular para cargarlos. No estoy seguro de que admitan carga r�pida, pero usando un cargador Samsung tardan menos de 3 horas en ir de 0% a 100%.Nunca us la versin anterior, pero considero que las funciones por las que valen la pena comprar estos en lugar de los XM3 son la posibilidad de conectar dos dispositivos a la vez y el que la msica se pause al quitarse los aud�fonos. Podr�an verse como dos funciones prescindibles a cambio de ahorrarte algunos pesos, pero una vez que las usas en el d�a a d�a te das cuenta de lo pr�ctico que son.Y como nada es perfecto, ac� van los puntos negativos. He tenido problemas de conectividad bluetooth en las llamadas y video conferencias us�ndolos en una PC Dell con Windows 10, lo cual ha sido un poco frustrante ya que los compr con la intencin de usar solo un par de auriculares para trabajar y escuchar msica. Intent conectarlos con cable para resolver el problema, pero al hacerlo la PC no detecta el micrfono. Esto ha sido un problema intermitente ya que en la mayor�a de las ocasiones funcionan bien.Otro punto negativo es la comodidad, aunque esto es un tema subjetivo. Personalmente no los encuentro tan cmodos como mencionan en otras rese�as, pero esto depender� de cada persona. Si usas lentes solo toma en consideracin que se vuelve un poco complicado y a veces incmodo ajustarlos con los aud�fonos puestos.En conclusin, son un gran producto para el ocio, 100% recomendables para usarlos con un celular o una Tablet, pero si estas buscando algo para usar con una PC probablemente debas buscar otras opciones.",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Justin J. Norman,Multi-device connection does not work with MacBook Pro and iPhone together,"I spent both a live chat session and SIX phone calls with Sony customer support trying to get these to work properly, to no avail. This is one of the most disappointing purchases I've made recently. Arguably the biggest selling point of the XM4 over the XM3 headphones is the multi-device connection feature, which supposedly lets you switch automatically between two devices. Without this feature, you may as well buy the XM3 headphones for $100-$150 less. It doesn't work when paired with MacBook Pro and iPhone. I've tried everything � restoring the headphones to default settings, deleting and reinstalling the app, deregistering and re-registering the headphones from both devices � nothing works. Search the Sony subreddit and you'll find a bunch of posts with the exact same problem when using a Mac and iPhone with this feature. The headphones will not switch connection to the second device. Both my MacBook and iPhone are running the latest versions of their respective OS. The MacBook is a 16"" model from 2016 and the iPhone is an XS.It seems completely nuts to me that Sony didn't detect this issue before putting these on the market. After six support phone calls and a live chat session, Sony did not offer to replace my unit. They told me the problem was with my computer and if I would like to return the headphones, I could. It would be one thing if the headphones had a compatibility warning that says ""Does not work with MacBook Pros"" or something, but there is no such warning. So if you use a Mac and an iPhone and you're thinking about getting these, please realize you may find yourself spending many futile hours trying to get this feature to work. If you don't care about that feature, I'm sure they're a great buy. The sound quality is great and the noise cancelling is excellent. Just pick up a pair of XM3 headphones instead and save yourself a chunk of cash.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Eliminator Performance,Over 1 second audio lag on Samsung TV,"These do not work on Samsung TV, just google it. Many people having the same issues as I did.Not 1 millisecond, 1 full second... it could even be more. For a $500 pair of headphones you'd think they'd be able to adjust this latency, or fix it with a software patch. Unfortunately their last software update was Aug 7, 2020 (over 2 months ago).I sent the 1st pair back because they thought it could be an issue with the headphones, and the 2nd pair has the same issues on Samsung TV.I've gone into the Sony headphone app and even set the headphones to (priority on connection) instead of the audio quality setting, and the Bluetooth connection still has a full second audio lag while watching a movie on my Samsung 4k tv. This is incredibly frustrating as you see people's lips moving but don't hear them speak.Disabling DSEE Extreme off/on or on/off seems to reset the audio lag, and fixes the stuttering, but it doesn't last more than 10 minutes.The noise cancelling is amazing, the battery life is amazing, the quick charge is amazing, the ability to connect multiple devices is amazing. They're very light weight and incredibly comfortable.",2,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Matt,Superb audio for bluetooth cans but some issues make them unusable,"Noise cancellation and audio quality are top notch. The bass is nice, clean, and punchy and the rest is pretty good for Bluetooth headphones.The issues I had and prompted a return for these cans is the mic quality and the touch controls. Pairing them with my desktop and laptops resulted in poor mic quality so Teams/Skype and discord are not usable since it uses a lower quality codec (AptX is GONE in the xm4's and the 3.5mm cable disables the mic). The touch controls aren't customizable so long scroll or short scroll for volume does not change the amount so it's tedious, and if you do it too quickly it skips songs or pauses.If you have no use for the mic and want good sounding Bluetooth headphones, these are them. If Sony fixed the mic issues from the WH-1000XM3 these would be almost perfect.",3,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Ricardo Giovani,Headphone excepcional,"Sem dvidas  o melhor headphone que tive em toda a minha vida. Comprei com um objetivo espec�fico: o cancelamento de ru�do.

Eu comprei na expectativa de diminuir o ru�do de vizinhos, e acabei sendo presenteado com uma qualidade t�o alta que chega a zerar o som que antes me incomodava tanto.Sobre a qualidade de som, eu tambm n�o tenho do que reclamar. Apenas uma palavra descreve: incr�vel. N�o sou audifilo, ent�o n�o consigo precisar a qualidade baseado em dados tcnicos e nem perceber defeitos que poderiam ser identificados por ouvidos mais treinados, mas o que posso dizer  que, para mim, um usu�rio comum e que vai utilizar na rotina do dia a dia,  mais do que perfeito.Em resumo, o que posso dizer : recomendo a compra, compraria novamente e com certeza acompanharei a linha deste produto no futuro, porque este headphone entrou para a minha lista de tecnologias indispens�veis.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

Florin Andrei,the previous model XM3 is better overall,"If you're an audiophile, or you care about the sound quality, all these headphones are mediocre. They are tuned to the taste of the average consumer - there's a lot of bass and not much else.Advanced users could fix the bloated bass. It involves using a parametric EQ and a preset based on precise lab measurements. I did that, and after the EQ they sound very good.Noise cancellation is very good. These headphones will remove most noise from the ambient. They are a tiny, tiny bit better than the previous model (XM3), but the difference can only be noticed if you have both headphones, and you switch quickly back and forth between them. Otherwise it's impossible to tell. I would say they are about the same if you're not very picky.The XM4 has a major flaw IMO: the electronics themselves make a bit of noise. You can hear it in the pause between songs, it's called ""hiss"" noise because it does sound like an animal hissing. It's not loud, but in silence you can hear it. To me that's not acceptable for noise cancelling headphones. They ought to be dead silent on their own. The XM3 (the previous model) are indeed dead silent in between songs. Most people may not notice this; if you're a discerning user, then you will hear it.They are very comfortable. I could wear them for hours without problems. Same for the previous model, which is almost identical.The battery lasts a very long time. After a full day's work, battery is at 70% for me. I guess it could last 3 work days if I didn't recharge it daily.I actually returned the XM4 and kept my old XM3.",3,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Tony M.Tony M.,DO NOT BUY THESE - unless you like disappointment.,"I received my first pair of these headphones last November.  I'd never spent this kind of money on myself for such a luxury item.  When they arrived I was over the moon because the sound quality was amazing.  About six weeks later, I took them off my head and place them on a side table.  And I am very careful with the things I own.  I never had much money growing up, so you learn to take care of your possessions.  Anyways when I went to use them again, the left ear had broken off of the head band and was hanging from the wires.  I contacted Sony who's response was, we don't cover damage.  WHAT?  I argued with them for quite a while and a few days later they agreed to replace them.Fast forward a few months later.  Now I am EXTRA carful with my second pair because of the problems with the first pair.  I am literally removing the headphones from my ears when the same exact thing happens again.  There was NO WAY that I broke them.  I have all the parts (see image) and the plastic is so thin that it just can't handle the weight of the ear pad.I called Sony again and they flat out refused to help me.  They told me they don't cover damage and that the best they would do would be to give me a 10% coupon for another pair.  What a joke!If you purchase these headphones, be prepared for this as looking at the engineering, it is only a mater of time before they will fail.",1,B0863FR3S9,Colour: Sliver,SONY,Headphones,
Michel,Teure aber sehr gute Bluetooth Kopfhrer,"Die Sony WH-1000XM4 sind sehr teuer, daf�r aber auch sehr gute Kopfhrer.Ich habe lange mit mir gerungen da dies doch ein hoher Preis ist, habe den Kauf jedoch bis jetzt nicht bereut.Die Geruschunterdr�ckung ist sehr gut.

Mit aktiviertem Tranzparenzmodus kann man sich unterhalten was ich aber aus Anstand nicht machen w�rde.Zum Telefonieren eignen die Kopfhrer (in Verbindung mit iPhone) auch sehr gut. Hier w�rde ich dazu raten den Tranzparenzmodus zu aktivieren damit man selbst die eigene Stimme besser war nimmt.Mein gegen�ber hat mir besttigt dass die Stimmqualitt sehr gut sei.Zur Tonqualitt ist eigentlich nicht viel zu sagen. Diese ist wirklich sehr gut w�rde ich sagen. Der Ton ist Klar in allen Bereichen sowohl hohe als auch mittel und tiefe Tne werden sehr Klar durchgegeben.Mit dem EQ in der App, kann man seine Tonpreferenz einstellen und diese wird dann vom Kopfhrer ��gespeichert�� auch wenn man andere Gerte benutzt. Dies ist eine praktische Sache. Ich finde die Kopfhrer sind in der Basis gut eingestellt, weder zu Basslastig oder Hhenlastig. Dies kann dann nach Wunsch eingestellt werden.Ich selbst hre damit auch gerne Klassik. Wenn gew�nscht kann man f�r Pop oder anderes dann auch im EQ mehr Bass einstellen und das funktioniert sehr gut.Die Kopfhrer gehen auch angenehm Laut ohne zu scheppern oder dass der Klang unklar wird.Falls mal der Akku alle sein sollte kann man die Kopfhrer auch sehr gut nur �ber Kabel betreiben und trotzdem noch eine sehr gute Klangqualitt genieen nur eben ohne EQ Einstellung.Man kann die Kopfhrer zudem mit mehreren Gerten koppeln, jedoch nur jeweils 2 aktiv verbunden haben.Der Wechsel zwischen den verbundenen Gerten 2 aktiven Gerten funktioniert ��gut��. Man muss am Gert 1 die Wiedergabe anhalten, dann auf Gert 2 die Wiedergabe starten und die Kopfhrer wechseln dann selbstndig von Gert 1 zu Gert 2.Whlt man nun auf Gert 3 die Kopfhrer aus wird jenes Gert welches am lngsten nicht mehr Benutzt wurde durch Gert 3 ersetzt.Die Kopfhrer lassen sich auch �ber Kabel benutzen und einschalten um mit aktiver Geruschunterdr�ckung benutzen, jedoch ist es jetzt nicht mglich ein Gert �ber Bluetooth zu verbinden um den EQ anders ein zu stellen. Entfernt man den Klinkenstecker wieder aus den Kopfhrern schalten diese sich wieder aus.Mit eingestecktem Klinkenstecker kann man die Kopfhrer im Passivmodus gut benutzen, wenn man diese jedoch einschaltet um z.B. die Geruschunterdr�ckung zu benutzen, schalten diese sich nicht selbststndig aus, sondern erst durch Bettigung des ein/aus Schalters oder durch abziehen vom Klinkenstecker.Ich hoffe diese Informationen sind hilfreich f�r noch unentschlossene.",5,B091CQH6VT,Colour: Blue,SONY,Headphones,
Kinomora,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! DANGEROUS LOUD SOUNDS!,"The media could not be loaded.                 �2022 update: THESE HEADPHONES ARE DANGEROUS!11 months after buying these headphones, on my 1st replacement unit already, they started producing a soft humming sound which quickly turned to an extremely loud screech MUCH louder than the system sound the headphones are connected to. I was able to consistently cause this issue to reproduce and attempted to report it to Sony who simply offered to replace them again! THESE HEADPHONES ARE DANGEROUS AND MAY CAUSE HEARING DAMAGE! DO NOT BUY!2021 original review:I bought these to use primarily with my Windows 10 desktop- which these headphones are clearly not designed to be used for.On Windows, the headphones show up as two separate devices- ""WH-1000XM4 Hands-Free AG Audio"" and ""WH-1000XM4 Stero"". You MUST set the AG Audio one to ""Default Communications Device"" and the Stero one to ""Default Device"" otherwise it simply will not work.My main grip with these headphones, though, comes from the fact that even though they have 9 integrated microphones for active noise cancelling, you cannot use any of them on PC while in high-fidelity audio mode. The device defaults to an audio quality lower than a piece of string connected to a paper cup if you have an application- like Discord or OBS- actively selected to use the ""AG Audio"" device.I just decided that I'd use my old, wired headphone's microphone for any audio input I needed, and use these headphones ""as intended by Sony"". Whatever, right? They still sounded amazing, they had amazing noise cancellation to the point where I couldn't even hear someone behind me talking.Well. That was true until about yesterday, when I started noticing I could hear things around me. I figured maybe my roommates were just being loud, but now I can actively hear someone watching television on the other side of the house while the headphones are set to ""Active Noise Cancelling."" So I've spent all evening looking at forum posts and other threads trying to figure out what happened and I'm finding that many, many other people are having the same issue with not only the XM4's, but the previous XM3's as well. After further testing, I've determined that when the headphones are set to ""Noise Cancelling"", they've actually defaulted to ""Ambient Noise"" with no way to fix this. I have tried factory resetting them, I have tried recalibrating them in the app, I've tried moving the slider around, turning it off, turning it on, resetting the headphones again, uninstalling the app, pressing the CUSTOM button on the side and NOTHING works.Turns out, Sony doesn't even have a support email. So now I need to wait until their helpline opens for either Live Chat or Phone to be told that I'll need to send them in for repairs. Lucky for me, my return period ended earlier this month so I guess I spent $350 on a pair of headphones that are notorious for experiencing issues after just 2 months of use.Not to mention that due to the shape and firmness of the headband and the weight of the device overall, likely due to the batteries (which I must say I am impressed with the battery life) I've noticed an unmistakable ""dent"" in my scalp where the band lays. Since I use these for >8 hours at a time, taking them off feels like I'm finally getting home from a long days work transporting water using a pitcher on my head. I've spoken to my doctor about this, and he tells me there's no chance it's permanent but it's very concerning to run my fingers through my head and feel what seems like nearly half an inch deep valley running across the front half of my scalp.Would I recommend these? Maybe, if you're the kind of person that buys new headphones every other month, and if you're really trying to solidify that Tyler1 cosplay these would be perfect for the job. For everyone else, I'd look elsewhere.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
E,Work great until they don't,"The media could not be loaded.                 �So I got these in November 2020 and overall, aside from some small pairing issues they've been amazing. Suddenly out of the blue they've started making a shrill feedback noise. From browsing online it appears to be due to the noise cancelling and microphone going amuck.There is very little help to fix this problem. Everything I try it comes back, making them the most annoying and unreliable expensive headset I've ever bought. I switched from Bose but now I'm questioning if Sony has enough long term quality to chance any more purchases.---- update---- the piercing noise just gets worse. These are unusable. Even turning off noise cancelling is a huge pain. I now have expensive ear muffs.",2,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Tushar Gupta,Do not buy. Static noise from right ears,"After a very slow delivery by Amazon, it came in a secure package. Looks bulky but premium. Just press power button for 7 sec to see connect it to a new device.Got it in INR 26990. Edit: Very sad now, one can get it in INR 23990 in Great India Sale.Sound: Excellent, bass heavy.Built quality: Looks study so far. Very comfortable on ears even with spectacles. I have been using it for 2 hrs straight and I can hardly feel anything on my head or ears.ANC: Although there is a stark difference when you hear things with active noise cancellation but still it is not perfect. I bought it because my study room is close to kitchen but alas I still hear utensils.Will update this review with time.Update 1: I have to admit sounds really great. Since it is base heavy, even at 50% volume, you get a theatre experience (no kidding).Update 2: ANC is not that great. Sitting in my room I can hear people talking next to me (cannot make what they are saying) while it does kills all the noises of fan.Update 3: After using it for 6 weeks, I hear static noises from the right cup. I found out that it was a common problem in XM3s as well. Do not buy this product.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Unreal Name,"Do not buy, premium price, half finished product","Let's start with the good.  The noise cancellation is incredible.  The sound quality is also quite good, when it works.  That's the rub.Cons:Connectivity Connection is fiddly on a good day and mostly just doesn't work well.  The internal bluetooth antenna is terrible compared to other headphones I have used.  The headphones constantly connect and disconnect.Bluetooth featuresno aptx low latency, so useless for video and gamesFitThese say they are over the ear but are smaller than any over the ear cans I've owned.  They rest on my ears and thus hurt after a few hours :(Built in AlexaThe technical term for this is a lie.  There is NO BUILTIN ALEXA.  What they mean by, ""built in alexa"", is that you can assign one of the two hardware buttons on the headphones to alexa.  When you press this, if you are connected to your phone and if the software works, then it will run alexa on your phone.  In practice I never got this to work on my android phone.Connecting to multiple devicesNot what it sounds like.  This is actually the same, ""feature"", that most headphones implement, only MUCH worse.  ie you can pair them to a bunch of devices and then easily switch the connection over.Only through the app, only to 2 discrete devices and the connection is noisy and twitchy and continuously shifts back and forthBasically none of the features really works.  The adaptive environment feature cuts in and out.  The touch controls half work and seem to randomly misinterpret gestures etc etcWhile stereo music sounds great, the hands free mode has VERY bad quality.  You can not use the quality stereo mode if you use the mic, so games, zoom meetings etc sound like a tin can.Oh and doing anything requires the app.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Francisco U.Francisco U.,Los audifonos mas inteligentes.,"Dia 1: (Primeras impresiones)Hoy despues de 2 dias de espera llegaron los audifonos, mi primera impresion al verlos es que si son grises y NO un color como beige como se muestran en muchas reviews (imagen1), son ligeros y muy comodos, otra cosa que me llamo la atencion es que me dieron 3 meses gartis en una aplicacion de musica de alta fidelidad a elegir, yo eleg� Tidal (imagen2), en cuanto al sonido si se escuchan muy bien aunque aun los estoy provando y comparando, lo que mas me ha gustado es toda esa tecnolog�a que incorpora, como que se pause la musica cuando me los quito o hablo, otra cosa que quiero ver como se comporta es su resistencia tanto de las almuadillas como de la diadema, se sienten de muy buena calidad pero siempre ha sido el talon de aquiles en audifonos (tuve unos beats studio que se rompieron y desgastaron de las almuadillas) seguire informando si algo mejora o empeora y como se comportan con el paso del tiempo, atentos.Dia 5: Algo que se me olvido mencionar el primer dia es que me llegaron con 30% de bateria, los use unos mimitos y despues los puse a cargar, no paso mucho cuando ya tenian el 90% y los desconecte y hasta hoy aun tengo bateria (30%) osea que gaste 60% en 5 dias de unas 5 horas diarias aprox, otra cosa que descubri es que son algo incomodos en el cuello ya que aunque se pueden voltear para abajo las almuadillas me aprietan algo la garganta, muy leve pero si es incmodo, y con el roze se enciende el asistente de voz por lo que termine desactivando el control tactil.",5,B0863FR3S9,Colour: Sliver,SONY,Headphones,
Shelby M. Thomas,"When I buy New, I want New!","I received this $350 pair of headphones which I thought would be new.  When I went to set it up it was already connected to ""Ian's phone"".  I'm NOT Ian nor does a Ian reside anywhere in my neighborhood.  I then realized that there was NO packing material in the box at all. No plastic bags, nothing was taped or sealed. I got them connected and the sound quality is on par with a $60 pair of Sony headphones that I bought for my wife. This may be the reason that Ian returned them.  There is a setting which cancels the noise cancellation when you speak, but it also pauses the music for 15+ seconds.  It's a great idea, if you need to ask what someone said before you start speaking, except for the fact that if you cough, sneeze, snort, laugh, or sing along it pauses your music. (That setting can be turned off.) I'm returning these and going to buy some from Best Buy to see if I received a defective pair since they don't sound as expected. I wish I could contact Ian to see what headphones he ended up buying.",3,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Vishal,Please Read Before you Buy,"Hi I bought this Headphones after a lot of research I hope this review help you to make an informed decisionBelow is the rating for each aspect of the Headphones (5 Star rating system)Active Noise Cancellation 4.7/5Well this is industry leading ANC we are talking about once the ANC is on you cannot hear anything from outside world be it music on your phone or movies on your television or gaming sounds on your computer .Comfort 4.8/5I have worn this thing 4-5 hours at a time and it doesn't feel heavy or my ears don't hurt a bit, cushions are nice and comfy and soft.Sound Quality 4.5/5Bass is a little low but it so makes up with such a crystal sound that you hardly notice itMic 4/5Microphone is where I had a little problem it seems when there is outside noise it works like you are on a speaker so you have to speak up a little but the voice is crystal clear for the recipient even it seems like you are talking from far off.Connectivity 4.9/5Bluetooth Connectivity is just awesome it has bluetooth 5.0 connection and connects to upto 2 devices at a time, which is a perk if you have multiple devices.Touch Controls 4.8/5Touch Controls on Headphones are simply awesome they are very easy to controlApp Controls 4.7/5Sony has an app to control headphones to maintain connection and even adjust equalizer and it even tells you how are you using your headphones. its has something which they are calling 360 degree sound something like spatial audio from apple (but it works only with some apps not all of them)Battery Life 4.9/5As advertised they say headphones battery life is 30 hrs in reality i have got upto 22 hours which i think is pretty decent considering the sound quality (which is very high)Charging 4.9/5It has quick charge feature so if your ever in a hurry just charge for 5 mins and your get about hours playback time which i think its pretty neatCall quality 4.8/5This is the only thing which was making me question weather or not I want to buy these headphonesexcept from mic sound like you are on speaker the call quality is very nice and voice quality is nice too it connects to all the apps which i was afraid it might not connect to namely WhatsApp, teams, WebEx, google meet etc. it works on everything so no worry on this front as many reviews out there say they had a problem with connect their headphones to these app this is not the case for me and it worked out on first try itself.Tested on iPhone 11 pro, iPad with M!, TCL TV with fire TV Stick, Sony TV with Fire TV Stick, Computer  Android phone",4,B091CQH6VT,Colour: Blue,SONY,Headphones,
Joce CJoce C,"Incre�bles, simplemente incre�bles.","Review completo como consumidor y profesional dedicado al audio, si te da flojera leer, de entrada te digo que esto vale cada centavo, no lo dudes ni esperes, rompe el cochinito porque te lo est�s perdiendo.Ahora si para los que dudan de Dios:Hace 3 a�os adquir� los MDR-XB950N1, mejor conocidos como los Sony Extra Bass. Sin duda fueron una compra demasiado buena, pas de unos Skullcandy Hesh 2 a los Extra Bass y vaya que la diferencia es muy considerable.Ahora, 3 a�os despus decid� hacer un ""upgrade"", yo me dedico a la msica, soy estudiante de la materia y me dedico al audio, la verdad es que no puedo llevarme mis aud�fonos de estudio fuera de casa, necesitaba unos que realmente ofrecieran buena calidad, portabilidad y facilidad de uso con mis aplicaciones. Encontr estos despus de hacer un par de bsquedas en internet, los compar con varias opciones y al final me decid� por comprarlos.En primera debo decir que he quedado impresionado por la tecnolog�a que traen estos aud�fonos. Puedes personalizar el audio acorde a tu oreja, as� es, a la forma de tu oreja, Sony te pide que tomes un par de fotos para que se puedan analizar y proveer mejor experiencia, nunca en mi vida hab�a visto algo as�.Desde que los abres se denota un producto bastante premium y que vale el dinero que se paga por l, ya que de hecho no es nada barato.La experiencia de abrirlo es excelente, pero es cuando bajas la aplicacin que empiezas a ver lo brutal de estas m�quinas. De adelanto estos aud�fonos ya vienen con carga m�xima, o al menos as� fue en mi caso, no te pide que los cargues ni nada, funcionan desde que los sacas de la caja. Son extremadamente cmodos y si eres miope como yo y usas fierros para ver, estos aud�fonos no te van a incomodar en ningn momento.No es que quiera advertir, sino m�s bien dar aviso de que por defecto los aud�fonos se oyen un poco flojos, el sonido est� un poco saturado, y si te gusta escuchar msica como el Heavy Metal o msica cl�sica te quedas pasmado, no se oyen para nada como los Extra Bass que al salir de la caja otorgan un sonido fino y bien configurado. Estos no, pero entiendo por qu lo hacen, ya que como mencion, la experiencia de verdad comienza cuando bajas la aplicacin que tiene como mil opciones de configuracin y optimizacin de sonido, as� que prep�rate para estar ah� unos 25 minutos de tu vida, que sin duda alguna por supuesto, lo valen.Una vez que has pasado las optimizaciones, toca jugar con el ecualizador, yo recomiendo configuracin 400: 1 1K: 3 2.5K: 7 6.3K: 8 16K: 5 Clear Bass: +5 o +7 para escuchar Heavy Metal y msica cl�sica, aunque si eres fan de los medios tal vez quieras mover un poco m�s, pero como dije, esto es libre y Sony te prev todas las herramientas para que esto quede sabroso.Ya con todo listo, toca escuchar msica, y ah� es cuando te da el golpe. Sab�a que habr�a una diferencia entre los Extra Bass que tengo y los M4 que son estos, pero no sab�a que realmente se fuera a notar tanto. Estos no son aud�fonos, son interfaces de audio andantes, adem�s, Sony te regala una prueba gratis en cualquier servicio de restringe que contenga su servicio Sony Audio 3D, yo escog� Tidal, pero tambin puedes escoger otros 3 m�s, ah� aparece la opcin.De verdad que escuchar msica en formato de alta calidad como es el FLAC que te ofrece Tidal es algo maravilloso, inclusive despus de varios a�os escuchando lo mismo, logr notar varios elementos musicales extras que antes ni sab�a que exist�an en la cancin, ah� es cuando te vas para atr�s, es como por fin escuchar las cosas sin filtro. Tambin recomiendo el formato ""Loss-less"" de Apple music en caso de que sean usuarios de iPhone o solo para que tengan una tercera opcin. Sea cual sea el servicio que escojan, se oye incre�ble, pero sin duda combinado con formatos de baja compresin esto se vuelve m�stico.Claro que esto no es tan plano como unos aud�fonos de estudio, pero sin duda la experiencia se acerca bastante.En conclusin, estos aud�fonos realmente son un producto bastante premium, te otorgan no solo alta calidad de audio, sino una experiencia tecnolgica muy innovadora, adem�s vienen con su porta audifonos y cables correspondientes, son muy cmodos y portables. Los recomiendo al 100% no duden en adquirirlo para nada.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Jason Brannock,Very Solid For Out-of-Office,"I left a lengthy review of the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. Since that review is out there, I'll reduce this one only to E285 and SX4.Microphone and PlaybackThe E285 was notably better than the SX4, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. Its neck and neck as far as clarity of voice goes.Akin to the E285, the SX4 are quite good as far as pick-up goes. But unfortunately, they were a little too good (or simply worse at distinguishing background noise). A co-worker and I had a Zoom meeting with ourselves in the same closet (to maximize productivity), switching between the headsets. Whoever had the E285 could hear themselves through the headset. At first, I thought it was because of the function where you hear yourself through the headset. But alas, upon one of us leaving the room, the echo went away. This meant the SX4 was picking up the others voice! The main killer of the SX4 is that you have no way to mute yourself from the headset. As a pair of headphones to be used in the office, this is crucial. You never know when someone may decide to butt in your closet (or office, for most people) and shout �HHHHEEEYYYY!!�. In contrast, the E285 offers two ways to protect yourself from such intrusions � by raising the boom arm or by pressing the button on the boom arm, leaving you to look down simply in resignation at said co-worker without having disrupted the meeting. The one drawback with the E285 is that sometimes the first word or two dont quite make it through, so you may develop a stutter of your introduction. �Im Jason � oh � IM JASON � oh you can hear me now? Im Jason�. Good news is, you shant be soon forgotten. Despite this, its more favorable than not being able to mute myself, though I can understand disagreement with this point. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophileBoth associated apps come with decent equalizers (unlike Bose). Honestly, it was difficult to tell the difference between the E285 and SX4. I think the amount of bass you get is comparable, however I think the SX4 is capable of producing an ever-so-slightly louder sound. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.BrandJabra: doesnt require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!Sony: same as Jabra, though with a caveat. The SX4 offers more utility when given Location permission, which will be addressed later on. They were not pertinent to me, however, so my location remains an enigma for Sony and Jabra (and Bose). Tie between E285 and SX4.ANCWhen playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what Im looking for), whereas the others dont quite succeed. The E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe its just higher frequencies) than the other headsets, though the SX4 is perfectly satisfactory.In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. It almost makes it sound like youre not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). The SX4 has essentially the same feature, with an added �Focus on voice� option. I couldnt tell a difference when that was on/off. Besides that, the SX4 didnt do as good a job at allowing sound through as the E285. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.ConnectivityThe E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. Unfortunately, I don't remember specifics about the SX4. SX4 and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesnt the B700? Because it sucks.Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because its just plug-and-play, no downloads or �connecting�. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard �add device�, etc. One annoying thing about the SX4 is you have to use the app to establish a Bluetooth connection to another device. Not a big deal, but for comparisons sake, the E285 is better. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writers humble opinion.Response time: The SX4 is the fastest, though were talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, Ive noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesnt resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC. So SX4 is better about ear detection (presumably because it's laser-assisted).App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I cant say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.Voice AssistantThe E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so its pointless). Tie between E285 and SX4.ControlsOn the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. Muting is done with the E285 by simply raising or lowering the boom mic. In contrast, the SX4 doesn't have any way to mute yourself.After just a little use of the �touchless� controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. Its certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.Comfort and StyleComfort is pretty much a tie between E285 and SX4. I've worn both for hours and hours without any issue. But I prefer the style of the SX4 - it just feels more premium. Winner is SX4. Runner up is E285.ExtraThe E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively dont want to listen to, like from mine or my roommates drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because theres nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.IssuesTheres some variability with functionality of the Google Assistant with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars, same as the SX4. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. I can't say the same for the SX4 since it was ultimately returned. I ended up choosing the E285 over the SX4 because it has an edge when it comes to office use, for one main reason - you can't mute yourself on the SX4. But if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

McRoy,"Wow! Toller Sound, innovative Funktionen, sehr gute Qualitt.","Ich muss gestehen, beim ersten Ausprobieren, als ich den WH-1000XM4 mit zwei anderen deutlich g�nstigeren Kopfhrern verglich, war ich vom Klang zunchst etwas enttuscht. Ich hatte sogar das Gef�hl, dass der billigste der drei Kopfhrer (Kostenpunkt etwa 1/10 des Sony) den besten Sound hatte. Trotzdem war mir der Sony von Anfang an sympathisch und obwohl er der mit Abstand teuerste der drei Kopfhrer war und ich eigentlich nur einen billigen kaufen wollte, zog er mich recht rasch immer mehr in seinen Bann. :-)Ich mchte auch anmerken, dass ich bisher kein Kopfhrer-Benutzer war. (bis auf hin und wieder EarPods zum telefonieren) Musik hrte ich zuhause immer �ber meine HiFi-Anlage und �ber Lautsprecher. Es war meine Tochter, die mich auf die Idee brachte einen Kopfhrer zu kaufen, damit sie ungestrt auf ihrem Handy Musik hren, Videos schauen und telefonieren konnte ohne von anderen (oder z.B. meiner Musik) gestrt zu werden. Ihre Qualittsanspr�che in Sachen HiFi-Sound sind nicht so besonders hoch - solange der Bass stimmt ;-) - und daher war mein Plan, einen Kopfhrer in der Preislage ""unter 50 Euro"" zu kaufen.Beim Aussuchen stie ich nat�rlich sofort auf die Frage, ob ich ein Modell mit oder ohne ANC kaufen sollte. Da der Kopfhrer hauptschlich zuhause zur Anwendung kommt, erschien mir ANC als nicht unbedingt notwendig. Trotzdem wollte ich es ausprobieren, um mir ein besseres Bild vom persnlichen Nutzen und von der Qualitt der Geruschunterdr�ckung machen zu knnen.Ich bestellte daher zum Vergleich einen Kopfhrer ohne ANC f�r etwa �� 30,-, einen mit ANC f�r etwa �� 40,- und schlielich den Sony WH-1000XM4, um auszuprobieren, um wieviel besser ein High-End Kopfhrer wre.Wie gesagt, der erste Eindruck war �berraschend.  Vom Klang her htte ich den Sony zunchst nicht unbedingt als besten der drei eingestuft. Aber das war u.a. noch ohne Verwendung der Equalizer-Funktion. Als ich den Sony mittels App etwas an meinen persnlichen Hrgeschmack angepasst hatte, geviel er mir schon besser. Und dieses Gef�hl verstrkte sich in weiterer Folge immer mehr. Qualitativ, vom Design her, und auch haptisch, sowie von der Handhabung hat mir der WH-1000XM4 sowieso von Anfang an am besten gefallen. Da merkt man halt den Unterschied. Die teilweise coolen Spezial-Features (z.B. Speak-to-Chat) und die zahlreichen Customizing-Mglichkeiten, die die Sony ""Headphones""-App bietet, sind ein weiteres Goodie des Sony. Mit der Touch-Gestensteuerung hatte ich anfangs ein wenig Schwierigkeiten, kam aber sehr rasch immer besser damit zurecht und freundete mich sogar damit an. (Ob mir Tasten vielleicht dennoch lieber wren, lasse ich mal dahingestellt. Ich bin mir da selbst nicht ganz sicher. Zumal der Kopfhrer recht viele Tasten bruchte, damit man alle Funktionen nutzen kann, die �ber Gesten mglich sind.)Nun zum Sound: Nachdem ich mich etwas mit den Einstellungen in der App ""herum gespielt"" hatte, konnte ich zunehmend die durchwegs sehr guten Testberichte in den diversen Fachzeitschriften verstehen und nachvollziehen. Der Sony WH-1000XM4 hat einen hervorragenden Klang. Ich bin zwar kein High-End HiFi Enthusiast (schon alleine deshalb, weil mein Gehr nicht mehr das allerbeste ist), aber am Klang gibt's wirklich nichts zu meckern. Sehr klar, gut ausbalanciert, mit durchaus satten und druckvollen Bssen, gut pronouncierten Mitten und differenzierten Hhen. Damit stand f�r mich dann relativ rasch fest, dass ich den Sony behalte und die beiden g�nstigeren Kopfhrer zur�ck schicke. Die etwa 200 Euro Aufpreis des Sony waren es mir wert. Der WH-1000XM4 spielt einfach in einer anderen Liga, das muss man ganz klar sagen. (Obwohl auch die beiden anderen Kopfhrer, insbesondere in Anbetracht ihrer wirklich g�nstigen Preise, �berraschend gut waren und aus meiner Sicht bzw. aus einer Preis/Leistungs-Betrachtung absolute Kaufempfehlungen sind.)Mittlerweile ist es sogar so, dass ich Musik nicht mehr ausschlielich �ber meine HiFi-Anlage hre, sondern teilweise bewusst mit dem Kopfhrer. (Streaming-Musik vom Handy) Es macht Spa und ist eine echte Ergnzung und willkommene Abwechslung. Ich liebe den kraftvollen Sound meiner Anlage mit den 5.1 Teufel Surround-Lautsprechern nach wie vor sehr. Aber z.B. sptabends, wenn man die Nachbarn schonen mchte, oder wenn man auf der Terrasse sitzt, ist es durchaus von Vorteil, einen so tollen Kopfhrer als Alternative zu haben. Ich bin daher meiner Tochter sehr dankbar, dass sie mich auf den Gedanken gebracht hat, so ein Teil zu kaufen. Htte ich ansonsten nicht getan. Und jetzt bin ich ein absoluter Fan des WH-1000XM und kann ihn voll und ganz empfehlen.Hier noch einige weitere Vorz�ge des Sony Kopfhrers aus meiner Sicht:- Angenehmer Tragekomfort- Schnes Design und coole Farbe (Midnight Blue!)- Zusammenklappbar und sehr platzsparende Aufbewahrung in der mitgelieferten Box (die von der Unterteilung her ebenfalls gut durchdacht ist)- Praktische und umfangreiche Steuerungsmglichkeiten �ber Touch-Gesten (lauter/leiser, nchster/vorheriger Song, ANC ein/aus, Musikunterbrechung um ein Gesprch zu f�hren etc. - erspart den Griff zum Handy)- Genial gutes Noise Cancelling. Also hier ist Sony wirklich top. Faszinierend, wie gut das mittlerweile funktioniert. (Beim ANC trennt sich u.a. auch die Spreu vom Weizen. Billige Kopfhrer knnen das bei weitem nicht so gut.)- Gute Akkulaufzeit und schnelle Aufladung- Gute App mit vielen Einstell- und Steuerungsmglichkeiten (ich verwende Android)- Gute Bluetooth-�bertragung- BT-Verbindung mit zwei Gerten gleichzeitig mglich- Innovative Kopfhrer-Funktionen wie z.B. Speak-to-Chat- Alexa Sprachsteuerung (hab ich zwar noch nicht getestet, knnte f�r mich aber n�tzlich sein, da ich vieles in meinem SmartHome �ber Alexa steuere)- USB C Ladestecker (viele billige Kopfhrer haben Micro-USB, das ich eigentlich fast nicht mehr nutze)- Insgesamt qualitativ hochwertige Anmutung (auch wenn groteils Kunststoff verbaut ist)",5,B091CQH6VT,Colour: Blue,SONY,Headphones,
DBDB,Broken in 4 months  - Poor Customer Service,"After doing a bit of research and reading the reviews I decided to purchase these.It is a great product outside the fact that it broke in four months. I used these as you would any normal headphones. I never took them out of the house, they were never dropped, and nothing has been done to these headphones to cause the issue that I am having. As I am watching TV from my bed, the missing piece (see image) pops out and now the right speaker just dangles and spins.I contacted Amazon customer service but their return policy is 30 days. They also instruct me to contact Sony for warranty.I contact Sony and speak to international customer service. I explain the issue to the first individual and because, ""We have no record of that happening to anyone else so it isn't covered under warranty"", but if it hasn't happened to anyone else, why has it happened to me?! I called back to speak with another individual only to have him echo the same thing the first person stated. Then when I asked him what's covered under the warranty all he told me is that he would email me a copy of the warranty and then disconnected the call instead of explaining the warranty information that I requested. Their own workers don't know what's covered. I might not ever purchase a Sony product ever again. These headphones are far too expensive to have to deal with this.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
MovieGoerMovieGoer,Excellent headset that CAN function as a Gaming Headset with a few hacks!,"So what can I say that hasn't already been said by everyone of repute. It's the active noise canceling, over-ear headset that MKBHD and dozens of tech Youtubers swear by as probably the best (or top 3) in its price range. In my personal use, the battery life is incredible (haven't drained it dry, but it's supposedly around 30 hours). The sound quality is great, although I'm not an audiophile so it's just my opinion. The noise canceling is also really good. I have the Sony noise canceling Earbuds and it's better than those (of course they have some passive noise canceling from being over-ear).What I don't think any Youtubers have talked about, is that with an extra $35 purchase, you can actually make this headset function perfectly with Xbox AND PlayStation consoles. I'm talking about the ""V-MODA BoomPro Microphone for Gaming & Communication"" (not sure if links work in a review, but this is it - https://amzn.to/3aA536a ). The microphone side connects directly into the 3.5mm headphone jack in the bottom of the left earcup and sits right next to your mouth and can be adjusted. On the cable of the microphone you have a mute switch and a volume wheel (for the headset volume not the mic). The bottom of the cable plugs into either gaming control. I have personally used it multiple times with both my PS5 and my Xbox Series X. I also tested it out with my old Xbox One X and PS4. While I have not tested it on the Xbox One, PS4 Pro, or the Xbox Series S, I have to imagine it will have similar results. I spoke to friends on Xbox and they said the mic sounded pretty good, but not amazing, then again it's only $35.The major downside to this whole setup is that the cable the headset comes with is super long (about 75"") and gets in the way a lot. You can throw rubber bands on it or order something online to manage it. I bought this ""Nite Ize Curvyman Cord Supervisor"" that can be seen easily in the 4th picture (link here: https://amzn.to/3hakkvC ). There are other options for wrapping it up, but this was $3 with free prime shipping and works great.All in all, a great setup that just works. I previously was using an ASTRO A50 with my Xbox One and don't even use that anymore. That headset frequently has random cutouts and you have to flip the mic up to mute which is annoying. I don't even miss the simulated ""3D audio"" that it supposedly has. The Sony Headset is the best!",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
mayank mauryamayank maurya,Great Headphone. Do need to fix glitches.,"I am a video editor. This is my first Active Nosie Cancellation(anc) Headphone. And let's review it.PROS:1. Talking about Nosie Cancellation in general: using anc Headphone gives you option to block outside nosie. Which could be looked in other way i.e. you can listen in quite low volume than you used to.With anc off I am listening to  about 50-60% volume with anc on its 20-30%.At the end of day your ear are much pleased and relaxed which is big thing as next day I have repeat the same.2. EQ : app has several EQ to suit different people and their different needs.And it's very easy to tweak EQ.I love flat EQ. It helps in two ways.A. Reduce listening fatigue. I use headphone 8-10 hrs and end of day I don't feel listening fatigue.I haven't have used any I repeat any headphone which not cause listening fatigue. (Listening fatigue is different from headphone clamp force)B. As video editor I do need everything in its very neutral state. And then tweak from there. So yes this is amazing.3. I used various headphone and earphone but haven't listened to anything which match it's sound quality.People talk about track seperation. You could realise with this headphone for sure.4. App is so good. People don't talk about app. It's really good and ease to use.5. Dsse extreme : It do work. It improve person talking.6. Controls : touch feels more fresh and practical as you don't look/feel for right button but there are time when you hear chime and it don't do anything.I find Google assistant works great. You can say to assistant to change to next/prev song or volume% or pause. It's super fast not like you take 2 secs and assistant think and repeat your sentence. You say, release assistant button and it's done.Plus you can do all with just a single button and as I am right handed mostly my hand is occupied with mouse or pen hence busy.And control is on right side. And assistant button on left side. If you think to invert sides it changes how next and previous work.7. Auto power off and music pause  : I find this feature so useful. I hardly turn off the Headphone.Even auto pause is really good. It not work for vlc or premiere.8. Granual volume adjustable : there are time when you listen to specific volume. Like 25% not 20 or 30 it's possible. Both touch control and assistant.It may not look much but those small things make you listen you hours and don't feel fatigue at all.CONS and Feature request:1. Any anc Headphone would create a pressure in your ear. It's called cabin pressure. It's like sucking you ear with a less power vacuum cleaner.Hope it could be reduced.2. This headphone do cause heat around your ear. Well removing headphone for a minute would fix that.3. Sweat problem is for real. Its told in youtube reviews. But many headphone do cause sweat problem....again remove, clean and wear again.Both heat and sweat problem gonna have their real test in summers.4. I had expected anc to be top notch. Don't get me wrong but as first anc I expect too much. Think anc as volume reducer.I can still listen fan and some other noise.Look I am video editor and my ear had trained in a way to listen sort of sound. So anc could depend from person to personBut if you play a music at 20-25% it do reduce outside noise quite a lot.5. Battery life : company claim it's 30hrs with anc on and 50% volume.My anc is always on and I listen in 20-30% volume maybe reach to 40% as well time to time.But I have to charge every 2 day. It's like 16-20hrs battery life.I got first one replaced but second one is isn't getting any close to even 25hrs.I don't have problem with every 2 day charge. It's pretty good to me. But not matching company's standard.6. Bluetooth sometime do stutter. Turn off and now mostly fix it. But I need fixing c'mon sony.7. Hope we can use Google assistant to toggle noise cancellation and different EQ.8. Customizing option for custom button. You can make your own fav function to have.Verdict : If you someone who have to work for hours on computer or feel outside nosie act as distraction for you, you work music or video editing this would serve its purpose for sure. And yes also for travel enthusiast.Wear Headphone for 5+ hour to feel comfortable.Headphone won't cause pain in ear. But cabin pressure and heat and sweat are problematic. It won't cause headache to me. Maybe if you listen to few hrs it would make you adjusted for that.Sound is amazing. Comfort is great so does anc but those could be further improved.Look no headphone I had used in past which could match it's comfort. I actually wear for 8-10 hrs each day. Well who doesn't need more improved products.",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Oh My Gawd,Greatest I've ever owned. Until it wasn't,"I am not an audiophile or one to buy expensive gadgets. But I needed a good set of cans to use while I work from home. I've been reading reviews on these since nearly the start of the human malware. But I just could not justify the expense. I caught these on sale and bit the bullet. I wish I had done it sooner. Great sound and great mic output. Every one of my callers, when asked, would say I sounded great and would have never known I was on  Bluetooth headphones unless they were told.Awesome ANCGreat fit - I have a large head. And I can go 10-12 hours in these no problem, Does get a tiny bit warm on hot days but the fan and ac negate that issue. And the ANC and mic hide all the extra noise from the background and calls.Decent for PC gaming. Not sure I would invest in these for the sole purpose. But if you use these for work and pleasure. These will fit the gaming audio check box. Not sure if it works for voice chat because I don't play any game with that feature.Having two devices connected at once was the main feature I was going for and it is implemented flawlessly here. I can be taking in content from the PC and a phone call comes in. Rings in the ear and on phone. Pick up call no problem, PC content auto pauses. Then pick back up right after the call ends. The only odd thing is notifications used to play in ear. For some reason that stopped. But no reason to take off a star.But then the headphones started to act up. Loud piercing sound in the left ear. Imagine being next to a concert speaker when there is mic feedback. Right in your ear. Not fun. Power reset sometimes fixed it. Sometimes it didn't.  Then other times the left ear would click. Sounded like a light switch being flipped off and on over and over. It got really bad after a few days so I chose to return them. I suspect the item I got may have been used? Upon closer inspection, the matte finish on the outside looked a bit ""worn in"". I wish I had paid closer attention in the beginning, but I was so excited to use them, I didn't pay attention. I would have liked to exchanged these for a new pair but the return process did not offer that as an option. Maybe that was on purpose? Who knows. But if I catch these on sale again I will definitely get another pair. Actively searching for the same deal. If you are in the market for a decent pair of ANC headphones that check most if not all of the boxes AND budget is not an issue. These are the way to go.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Disappointed User,Whistling Noise,"The media could not be loaded.                 �The sound quality is good, and the noise cancellation is impressive, to the point where it may be too good and feeding into the major issue below.There's a serious problem that has cropped up in my pair and others have experienced this as well. A loud whistling noise that's sometimes present, but only when noise cancelling is on and is preceeded by an increased pressure on the offending side (I experienced this on the right side). If you search online other users have experienced this as well with few solutions beyond replacement (I've included a video from the Sony forums)It doesn't help that if you don't use sony's app, you can't turn the noise cancelling off unless you're connected by a cable, which defeats one of the main reasons for buying these headphones.I'm outside of the warranty window and it was cropping up just before then (just to reiterate, that's a pair of headphones costing several hundred that can't last a year of someone listening to music and gaming after work for a year), but I couldn't reliably recreate the conditions that caused it.Avoid these if you can, or like me you'll be afraid to turn the things on for fear of having your eardrum damaged. Only reason I can still them somewhat is because you can attach the cable and don't have to turn them on, so they'll work like a regular pair of headphones a third or fourth of the cost. Which I'd have got instead if I knew this could happen.Needless to say, I won't be getting these again.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Tejas,Static noise in right earcup,"Constant static hiss like sound in the right earcup. This started after around 2 months of usage. Went to the Sony service centre to rectify the issue. They took my headphone and after some days when I called them to check the status their response was - ""There is no problem, the headphones are working fine.""FOR A RS 30,000/- IF THIS IS THE KIND OF PRODUCT YOU ARE OFFERING TO CUSTOMERS, THEN IT'S A MATTER OF INTENSE SHAME.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Jeff,They just don't sound good enough.,"I've owned a lot of headphones over the years; most of them wired, without any noise cancellation. I think ANC is a great innovation, though, and my first pair of noise canceling headphones were the Sony MDR10RNC's back in 2015. These didn't sound all that great, but I only bought them for use on airplanes, and they looked and felt really nice. That combined with the noise canceling made up for the lack of sound quality. I actually loved these headphones for what they were, which was a way for me to feel less fatigued after a very long flight, while also allowing me to enjoy the on-board IFE.Fast forward to today, and I've just spent $350 on a new pair of Sony wireless noise canceling headphones. With five more years of R&D under Sony's belt, a much higher price tag than I paid for my MDR10's (they were about $140) and great reviews around the net, I had high expectations. For this kind of money, I expected not just a set of cans I could use on a plane but some everyday hi-fi headphones for music too. Unfortunately, they just don't sound very good, even with noise canceling off. I've tried them wired, wireless, on and off (you can use them turned off when wired), with noise canceling on and off, and using both AAC and LDAC codecs. The problem seems to be the headphone drivers, which is fundamental to the hardware.I probably should have known better. These are mass market headphones, and even at fairly high prices like this, people today don't seem to be looking for accurate sound reproduction; they're looking for a lot of bass. These have that; I wish I'd seen this before buying but headphones.com (no affiliation!) tested their frequency response and found a ""v-shaped"" curve that emphasizes bass and to a certain extent treble. Unfortunately, the mid-range is where most of the music is, so really good-sounding mid-range and flat frequency response is the sign of a good headphone. These do have a cell phone app where you can set a custom EQ, and I did that. Unfortunately, the mid-range reproduction in these headphones just isn't very good - it sounds tinny and harsh, so the flatter you make the frequency response, the worse it sounds. These just aren't very good headphones in terms of sound quality, and I expected a lot better for $350.In fact, I also own a pair of Cowin E7 Pro's, which are $60 Chinese wireless ANC headphones, and they sound almost as good as these. I had bought those literally the day before a flight because I found out I wasn't going to be able to plug in my headphones to an IFE system, and they were cheap enough to be an impulse buy. But they're totally fine for that price; they don't sound great but they're not absolutely awful either, they also have a ton of bass and their noise cancellation is adequate. For almost six times the price, I would expect these Sonys to sound a lot better, and they just don't. I was trying to upgrade and I'm not sure I really have.As for the active noise canceling itself, yes, it's pretty good. My MDR10's noise canceling was pretty good too, five years ago. So are the Cowin's. Maybe I'm just more picky in terms of sound quality than noise canceling, but I feel like every ANC headphone cancels noise pretty well, though not perfectly - these are still tuned mostly for jet engines, and you're still going to hear stuff in higher registers. The WH-1000XM4's do have a slight hiss in ANC mode that means you probably won't want to use ANC at home. I noticed this right away and tested my other headphones to see if they did the same thing, since I hadn't noticed it before. And they do, but the frequency of the hiss on the 1000XM4's is a bit higher. It's not louder, just higher, so that's probably why I immediately noticed it.Lastly, I am not a fan of the build quality of these, especially compared to my MDR10's - which, again, are also Sony ANC headphones and were much cheaper. The MDR10's look and feel premium, even today. The 1000XM4's look and feel like cheap headphones. They're all black plastic and just don't have the premium look or feel that I'd expect from a $350 set of headphones. They also seem to have a higher clamping force that makes them a little uncomfortable after an hour or two of listening. It's not noticeable at first but becomes noticeable pretty quickly.If these cost $150, I'd say they were worth it. I do not think they are for $350.I am seriously considering returning mine.",3,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Brandon ReagleBrandon Reagle,Flawless...,"So I bought these because the Dog barks constantly during my 2hr weekly yard maintenance.  I have had the echo ear buds since they were only a rumor and they actually do great for the price, but I wanted bigger base and pure silence.They came on a Wed  and I already had the app and made an excuse to mow below the hill weds before dark... I have not cussed that much... honestly maybe ever! Everytime you sing along they stop, everytime you start the mower they stop, the noise cancelling was poor. I dont have a temper but I've never wanted to throw anything as hard as I wanted to throw these things.  Got 30% done and it was too dark. I was turning off voice controls, I was turning off environment recognition.  Restarted the app.I had also bought the jbl highly recommended over ear like 2 weeks prior... and was disappointed by them.Went to bed recharged phone, went to finish yard the next day... clicked off voice recognition, clicked off environment recognition... it now gave me an option for like 12 levels of noise cancelling and these things are great.  I run them through another volume booster app and the dog is gone, the mower is gone, just every inappropriate song from the 90s and 2000s that I'm not allowed to play in the house!The one thing I didnt think about is I cant wear a big shade hat.But these things will recognize you are walking into the house and change setting, they have a voice recognition option which is cool unless you sing along. They have a button to push to make commands like alexa add this song to my playlist...These are definitely worth three times the jbl set, the 360 sound that I cant figure out how to use is insane!! Not... gaming ""im over here"" but like my mind knows exactly how far over there you are in a perfect sound bubble insane! Its insane.  Id pay like 50 a month for all my music to be in that format.... but as far as value and everyday use I bet some new version of the Alexa Ear buds at less than $100 may fit a few peoples needs better. I wanted over ear sound immersing head phones and I'm real happy with these! Oh battery never runs out.  My phone dies and I only use that phone for Alexa.

gargvishal,Does not work properly with MacBook Pro,"I connected the headphones with my Android phone and MacBook pro. I tried recording audio in Mac and the recording is very bad. The sound breaks. I then googled and found that others are also facing this problem. Just search for: ""Microphone problem when connected to MacBook Sony xm4"".  I called Sony support and they say my MacBook is bad! The simple and straight solution from Sony in 10 seconds: It is my computer's problem. I then dug further and it seems that Sony does not support Macbook pro. I cannot put the link of the website (amazon does not allow putting links in the reviews) but read this post (search on Google with quotes: ""WH-1000XM4: certainly disappointed"")I then thought of returning the product and I found that this is not returnable on Amazon. There is only replacement option. Amazon agent was helpful and tried various things to resolve the issue such as restarting the device, re-pairing it with computer etc. Nothing worked and I am being provided with a replacement. I doubt it will work because Sony does not support MacBook! Total waste of money. If you are a MacBook user, think twice before you buy it.UPDATE on 3rd Oct: I received a replacement from Amazon. Same problem in this new unit. I received an email from Sony instructing me to reinitialize the headphones. It did not help. Sony is now asking me to take it to the service center. There is one service center in near my place and is it is closed. Sony should simply accept that the product is not yet ready and stop troubling the customers.

Dan,"Good headphones, terrible connectivity/app issues","The headphones themselves are fine. They sound good and aren't too uncomfortable.Now for the issues, which make these headphones a no-go for me:1) App Necessity - In order to pair with a device, apparently you have to install the app on your phone. This is a problem in itself, as I shouldn't need an app! Bluetooth pairing should be all one needs to do. Additionally, there is no app for Windows 10 and I wanted these headphones primarily for work on a Windows laptop. You have to use the app on a phone in order to pair the headphones to a laptop. What a fail.2) Pairing Issues - The headphones do not consistently pair to devices, when attempted.3) Switching between two devices - So, I had these headphones connected to my phone (by necessity - see above) and to my laptop. Switching between the two is a nightmare - it just doesn't always work. Additionally, and this is my chief complaint, when I am on a work call on my laptop and then I get a call (usually a spam call) on my phone, the headphones automatically switch to the phone. Even when I ignore the call on my phone, the headphones do not automatically connect back to the laptop. This makes these headphones completely unusable for work. Imagine presenting to a client and this happens. Now for the kicker - I contacted Sony support and they said there is no way to disable the auto-switchover feature. Wow...With respect to #3, I found a quasi-workaround. First, I tried to just disconnect the headphones from the phone, but I would have to do this every single time I put the headphones on, because they auto-connect to the phone. Then, I just deleted the app from my phone and also deleted the bluetooth connection on my phone. Now, the switch-over issue doesn't happen, but I can't use the headphones with my phone without setting up and deleting the bluetooth connection each time.As such, I am returning these",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

In my humble opinion, these should be given a miss unless Sony rectifies this issue.

In a humid environment like the coasts, this doesn't stand a chance (as in my case).

I used to have mid range Sennheiser, Sony and i couldn't wear them all day as i'd wear these and on top of that, best in class noise cancellation lured me into keeping this and not going for a return, so finally after a long invisible battle in my mind with myself, i decided to keep these and cut to February, three months later, my mic stops working and mind you, these are premium headphones and i am using and treating them with care as even though i decided to keep them, i wouldn't forget the fact that i shelled out 25k for these and boy, that's  a lot of amount, at one period of time, that's more than my monthly salary so i know the importance of these and was treating them with care, YET, within two months the mic stops working and i called in the customer care and they sent me a address of a service center which is 70km away and they don't have a pickup drop service so i myself have to drop in the product at my expense and they said they don't have the parts/replacement unit ready so it would take them at-least a week's time and then i have to collect the product myself again at my own expense.I'm yet to visit the service center, but i already feel frustrated because 25k is a lot of money and this product doesn't justify that price tag and what's ironic is even after buying the product within two months, i'm still spending on this as if the 25k weren't enough already -_-Speaking from my experience, I would sincerely suggest you guys to think twice and spend you hard earned money wisely.Product Experience:I. TBH, it's a mediocre product, the sound is mediocre and will leave you in wonder, for you to think why did i shell out 25k for this piece of trash, BUT, this sound paired with the noise cancellation gives you amazing results as the noise cancellation blocks out major noises so you can hear the sound crisply even at low volumes. Again, 25k isn't justified according to me.II. LDAC is shitty and pointless:  1. I'm no audiophile and as a normie i didn't notice a big difference in LDAC and other codecs like aptX.  2. LDAC won't work in Multiple device connect mode so LDAC is as good as s.h.i.t.III. Touch sensor is finicky and won't work as intended when you are sleeping and wearing the headphones.IV. It pauses the playback when headphone is removed but at times it won't play the playback when you wear it back again. There are lots of features like these which are quite finicky.V. 360 Audio is horse s.h.i.t, tbh i'm not even sure what does it do and how to turn it on, this feature is clumsy af.VI. Microphones are weak and can't be used for proper calling as the pick up lot of noise from outside more than our voice and the other party always complains.VII. Battery life is decent, quick charge works well without issues (so far).VIII. I'm away from the equalizer as i'm no audiophile but it does work.Final words:If 25k isn't a huge deal to you, buy this, and only for noise cancellation. if you are coming from below 10k segment, you would enjoy the super soft ear cups as well. Other than that, don't expect anything else.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
fran,noise cancellation sucks. No APTX support.,"They are comfortable, sound good and that's it. there's your $500. the rest sucks. No Aptx support so if like me you use these on Windows 10, you will have a 500$ headphone using SBC codec, therefore limited to low quality mp3 like sound.  Then, I expected better noise cancellation from a $500 headphone. Noise cancellation does everything but block stupid people laughing and talking besides me. thus, need to pump up the volume and possibly hurt my ears. I really regret my purchase after all the hype around these. reviews everywhere said they were the best. In my opinion, they are no better than my kids 50$ headphones. Yes, the sound is good. but I constantly hear this white noise in my ears. If i turn of noise cancellation, I hear people around me even loader than without headphones. it's really unpleasant. Seems Sony WANTS you to hear other peoples conversations. I get that sometimes on the move, near a street, you need to hear but then again, if I choose not too, that should be my choice.So my advice is do not by just because of the noise cancellation cause its not what it is. It does not cancel sound. It blocks certain noises but these noises when listening to music would not bother anyhow. Voices however need to be blocked out but are not. I actually even use then in the house for fun when I want to ease drop on my kids phone conversations when they are in their room. I hear them better with the headphone on as it amplifies other peoples voices. Great job on noise cancellation Sony!",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Customer,Exceeds my expectations! - Highly recommend for sound quality & noise cancellation,"I hesitated before purchasing this product since it's a big investment. The experience is AMAZING so far with sound quality, noise cancellation, built quality, and battery life. I'd strongly recommend this product and can gladly say that this is one of the best headphones out there.Plus, Amazon really exceeds my expectation in terms of shipping & delivery. At first, Amazon promised me that they would deliver the product 2 days after the launch. However, it ended up delivering the product within just 1 day, making me one of the first customers that can try on this product. So 5 stars for Amazon as well!",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
V,Great Sound but Frustrating to use,"The sound is lovely. Crisp, smooth, absolutely top tier. Could use better bass, but the bass is also deep. I'm dock points off because the ear pad sensors are finicky, and the headset kept powering off at max power and the blue tooth kept disconnecting. I was skeptical about the mics, but I was able to be heard very clearly over discord calls, so that's great. I would not recommend these at all for gaming, because when you speak, the headphones interrupt the sound/music, so chatting to teammates while listening for game audio is a no go. Which means not hearing enemies, potentially, or just enjoying the bgm. I'm not docking points for these, ultimately, not being for me, but for functionality. The design is smooth, very, very comfortable and nicely built, but some ideas were simply not executed very well and that's a shame. I really really wanted to like these, but I bought them to cure a headache I was having with my last headphones, not take on another.",2,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

David Diskin,"GREAT for Music -- BAD for Calls, Teams, etc","Because I do so many meetings over Teams (I'm a professional software trainer), I thought it would be time to finally invest in a really good headset. Up until now, I'd been using a $50 over-ear set by MPOW with a really nice boom mic. It was great, but it wasn't wireless, certainly wasn't portable, and didn't have the audio quality I'd want when listening to music.I thought that by splurging more than $300 on a Sony product I'd get something that was beyond all of my expectations. I was almost right, but so very wrong in other ways.CASE: Let's start here. The case is as slim as can be, very high-quality build, looks nice, feels nice, keeps everything protected. Excellent design here with one flaw: you can't really charge the headphones while they're snug in the case; they don't fold up the right way.APP: To use most of the features, Sony requires you to download an app to your smartphone. That wasn't a big deal and the app was easy to figure out. It crashed twice on me (once during the first setup, again the next day). It offered some location-based services but I declined and it never asked me again. It wanted me to sign up for a free trial of some 360� music service -- not sure what that is, but I skipped it. I was disappointed that there wasn't a PC version of the app. For example, if I needed to switch which device the headphones were connected to, I can only do that from my phone -- that means my phone always has to be one of the two devices. There's no way to control the advanced features, or the equalizer, from the PC.PAIRING: Bluetooth pairing was hit or miss, over and over again. If I were only pairing to my phone, I think it would be fine. But I wanted to also pair it to my desktop and laptop. The device supports pairing to two devices at the same time -- which was great -- but nearly every time I wanted to switch devices I had to literally turn off bluetooth so the headset would ""let go"". Other times, upon reconnecting, the mic wouldn't work. Once, which turned out to be the final straw for me, was when I could not get the headset to work in Teams no matter what I tried, even though it worked fine a few hours earlier. (For context: I literally train employees and other trainers on how to use Teams, so I very much know what I'm doing.)SOUND QUALITY: Let me say that the sound quality IS exceptional. I had a blast listening to all my favorite songs streaming from my phone or laptop. I really can't understate the quality, base and treble. And the ANC (active noise cancelling) was AMAZING. I could be sitting right next to a whole house fan and not hear it. I was blown away.RANGE: Twice during the day I tried walking around while on a call. It wasn't until I went downstairs that anyone said the quality of my voice had dropped. If I was less than 25 feet from the device, everything was great.BATTERY LIFE: After a day of use it was down to about 50% and that impressed me. Then I watched TV and ate dinner and later that evening I put on the headphones and realized that the battery dropped to 10%. I thought the system had an auto-off feature but something didn't quite work.CHARGING: So after my surprise drop in battery, I plugged it into my desktop with a USB C cable I already had. A little light on the headset turned red. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to learn that the headphones were still at 10%. Apparently the USB C cable I use to charge my mouse won't charge the headphones. I guess you need to use the cable it ships with? I'm not sure what the deal was here, but that was pretty annoying.CONTROLS: I found the touch/gesture controls to be mostly intuitive. Pro Tip: If you swipe up and hold your finger, the volume slowly increments up. Once, however, I accidentally hung up a Teams call when I was trying to adjust the volume. I love the feature that let's me hear ambient sound by cupping my hear -- super cool. Tap the power button to hear the battery level -- very nice touch! However, there's one extremely important flaw in the controls that I was shocked to discover. THERE IS NO MUTE BUTTON. The ONLY way to mute your mic during a call (Teams, phone, Zoom, etc) is to use the mute button on the desktop/phone. The headset, whose very first bullet is ""clear hands-free calling"", has five built-in microphones, and a dedicated gesture to use Alexa... doesn't have a damn mute button. Sadly, the successor to this (the 1000XM5) has the same flaw.Individually, the issues I raised wouldn't be enough for me to return the headset or give it a low rating. But for a $350 purchase, I expect it to be able to do what it says correctly. I expect a mute button. I expect it to power off when not in use. I expect any generic USB cable to work. I expect to be able to join a meeting without fussing with bluetooth.I'd totally keep this if all I wanted it for was to listen to music.",3,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Amazon Customer,Great for Autistic People but with faults,"As a diagnosed Autistic Person (Aspergers) I gave these headphones a 5 Star review because even though they have some faults I do think they serve their purpose.These headphones are great for basic use like travel and at home / at work use.  I personally use them to drown out the noise from a very noisy daycare I live next door to, or if i've had a long day of Sensory Processing and I'm drained and can't cope with background noises or volume control of other people's voices any more.  I definitely recommend them for people who are ASD or with Sensory Processing issues.  I enjoy wearing them when i'm working too as they help me concentrate on my tasks without having my attention diverted by auditory distractions.The things that aren't the greatest about them -*  I do not recommend them for exercise such as Running.  They are very sensitive and even when i go outside I turn down all noise canceling sensors on the app, just to stay quiet at the lowest level.*  The Speak to Chat function is cool, but can be annoying when you just clear your throat and it activates.  The headphones are so sensitive that sometimes when I try to return back to Noise Canceling it switches off the function all together.*  Volume adjustment is not the greatest either.  Having to slide your finger up and down one little bit at a time makes the whole function extremely slow.  The skip or go back swipe function is cool but again, it's so sensitive that if you swipe accidentally or a little off angle it feels that.*  I also don't really like the material they are made of.  Be sure to give them a wipe every day as the material easily gathers natural occurring oils form your skin and hair.*  It has this cool all surrounding music function, but you can't get that unless you purchase a specific music app for it.  Spotify doesn't support that sadly.*  It's great that it can pair with 2 devices at a time, but sometimes that causes one device's volume to not work and I have to switch off the other device and start all over again with pairing.*  For some reason it constantly switches on itunes every time i connect it to my computer.But as I said, I do love to wear them a lot and they help me out immensely, especially around the house, everyday tasks  and with concentration.I hope that with future products these things will be adjusted, but for now we're so lucky to have such cool technology.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

Venkata D.Venkata D.,From a Windows User Perspective,"Owning a noise cancelling headset is a 9-year-old dream of mine. I never was able to justify paying 25 to 30k though. Finally, my wife decided to gift me the headset for my birthday. I have read and a lot of reviews for this headset online. All of them are from the perspective of a cell phone user. I use my headset mainly with my laptop and my iPad. Having dual connectivity was a must feature for me because I have a movie or YouTube video playing on my iPad and continue to work on my laptop. I take around 3 to 4 hours of zoom calls on a typical working day so call quality was also a very big priority. Now that you have the back story here are pros and cons.Pros1) Very comfortable. I use them for around 10 to 15 hours a day and I feel a discomfort after having them on for at least 5 hours. I think that is good enough session without taking a break.2) Noise Cancelling � As long as you dont expect miracles. It does a good job of blocking the fans in my room, my laptop fan, my keyboard noise. If you have a TV on you can still hear it (although at a low volume).3) Connectivity � I didnt have any issues with the connectivity in the two weeks I have been using this for. Connection was always stable.4) Sound Quality � I am no audiophile. My music source is Apple Music. I am happy with the way my music sounds or twitch steams sounds.Cons1) Call Quality � I am not sure if this is an issue in just my device or if it is a common issue. But, almost every time I take a call on zoom for the first 2 to 3 minutes, it sounds like other persons voice is coming from a tube. I didnt face this issue while taking calls from phone or iPad. So, I dont know what exactly is causing this issue but is super annoying to deal with every time.2) Battery Life � Please dont go by advertised battery life. I never got more than 16 hours. Which is nothing to laugh at and can still last me through a working day and I can charge it once every day.3) APTX � These headphones dont support APTX or APTX HD. As an IOS and windows user the best I can use these headphones with is AAC which is a bit disappointing. Some of my friends own XM3 and they are super happy with them on windows. My suggestion is if multi connection is not a must for you go for the XM3. They are still a very good headset and they give you excellent call quality on windows.4) Speak to chat � Even after setting the sensitivity to low it gets activated every time I hum the song even very slowly. Good that it can be turned off in the app and I turned it off in the first two days of usage.Despite the cons I love these headphones to bits and pieces. I hope the call quality issue resolves with more burn in or with a software update down the line. I used XM3s, Bose QC 25, 35, 35II and NC 700 (borrowed from my friends). I think these and XM3 have the best audio quality if you a general user. I have no idea about audiophile level details. If your budget permits and you dont take a lot of calls on windows laptops, I would say go for these.",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

marta,its worth buying if you ever catch it on a sale!,so ill start from top to bottom. the headphones over all are fantastic. they don't get too hot or uncomfortable after long use. the ear pieces are holding up well and ive beating them up in the last few weeks ive used them. so i mainly use them for the gym. theyre great for doing everything BESIDES having to lay down to do any kind of workout. giving theyre not ear buds its not a big deal.noise cancellation is fine and youre able to fine tune it. the option is there whenever i do need some quiet space to do work or anything. but i end up not using it much. the transparency mode is great. i can hear people loud and clear doesnt sound muffled its almost like im not wearing them. the sound quality is great. i was daily driving in ear monitors and going these didnt feel much of a difference. theres alot of room to play with EQ BUT i would not use EQ built in the apps. it throws alot of the sound off and it doesnt feel right. i would tune everything from within their app. bass quality is great. some days I want more of pump and they easily can push out a good amount. or when im just listening to a podcast it makes the vocals very crisp. over I love them. they are on the pricy side but I personally think they're way better than the airpod maxx. ALSO side note. if you got really big ears these are great they still hold in place there is plenty of room inside the cups themselves and are super soft and dont get annoying. and i can work out for a few hours and still be okay.,5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Kaladin StormblessedKaladin Stormblessed,Saying Goodbye to Bose...,"I've been pro-Bose for YEARS (QC35's being the most recent headphones). Not necessarily for the booming bass/audio quality, but for the convenience factor (on the go, on the plane, zoom meetings, etc...), excellent battery life + amazing noise cancellation. To balance, I have a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 2.0 (though oddly designed), sound great both via Bluetooth or cabled/analog via a DragonFly, playing FLAC, etc...Well..., my QC35's encountered the infamous always-on ""feature."" Flipping the button to off will give you an audible beep that it's being powered off, only to find that you missed 20 calls in your log that you never heard ring. If you're under warranty, you're golden (they'll offer to fix or a discounted upgrade). If not, you're forced to operate with miniature tools under a magnifying glass to bend the button contact points to maintain constant connectivity to the board. My QC35's were months out of warranty & I was SOL... Hacked per all the DIY vids which worked well for about 6 months. Earlier this week, however, I noticed several missed calls + the Bluetooth connection active. Sure enough, the Bose were ""back at it again..."" Didn't feel like hacking for another 6 month band-aid, so seriously considered picking up a pair of 700's. My coworkers, however, (the same ones who all originally had/suggested Bose), said they switched to Sony months ago... After researching pros & cons/side-by-side comparisons, the WH-1000XM4's seemed more & more a worthy competitor/option...Go-To Amazon of course had the WH-1000XM4's in-stock (& $60 cheaper than the Bose!), so ordered without hesitation. Headphones arrived (packaging & product) looking very slick (nice touch w/ the rose gold accents on black. Charged for about 30 minutes, then tested audio & call quality... BLOWN AWAY... Streaming music, movies, etc... seemed lightyears beyond what I subjected myself to w/ the Bose. My QC35's sounded flat & bass was non-existent. These headphones feel like I'm back in the mid 90's, cruising in my lowered Accord on wire wheels, bumping my Cerwin Vegas powered from an M100 Phoenix Gold Amp w/ Boston Acoustic pro series highs/mids. Yes, ""slight"" exaggeration (anyone w/ 12"" Vega's know what I'm talking about), but it DID take me back... Beyond impressed... No issues w/ audio quality as well on my Zoom's or direct bt to my phone.So..., audio quality is OUTSTANDING... What caught me off guard, however, was the noise cancellation! I thought Bose was amazing, but Sony's latest technology is on another level. It works so well, it's scary... Damn near can't hear a thing when they're on. Without any audio at all, it's as if you're trapped in ""soundproof vacuum purgatory,"" with nothing but you & your now blaringly loud tinnitus to keep you company. When you take them off after a few hours of wearing, you (to be continued: Apparently, my family has been calling my name for the last 10 minutes. They gave up & sent my youngest upstairs to physically wave her hands in front of me @ my workstation to tell me we're eating soon. Yes, the noise cancellation is THAT good). Ok, continuing where I left off above: When you take them off after a few hours of wearing, your ears are now hyper-sensitive to every day sounds. Birds chirping, humming of video equipment, the heater, etc... I always assumed that Bose was the leader in this technology, but Sony just knocked it out of the park...As far as cons? Very minimal & more of annoyances if anything... I use mine strictly for voice & audio (though I did install the app), so not really taking advantage of any of the advanced features. The Bose has a massive R & L inside the padding + the on/off switch is an easy queue as to which side is R or L. The Bose padding at the top of your head also appears to be a bit firmer/more comfortable. With the Sony, the buttons are camouflaged into speakers & the R & L are tiny (but color coded) markers on the inner headset. Marking is tiny, but as long as you associated Red with Right, then you're golden. Also, after a prolonged period of time, the very top of my head was throbbing/sore. I'd have to raise the headset slightly to give the to of my skull a break. Again, these are merely minor annoyances & the pros far outweigh the cons...Can't really say much more & for those TLDR, Sony's WH-1000XM4 put my Bose QC35's to shame (voice, audio & outstanding noise cancellation). Not sure how long these suckers will last, but assuming they stand the test of time, I don't see any reason why I'd ever return to Bose...",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

Jonny Zee,Do not believe the YouTubers!,"I've had these for a few days now so please keep this in mind. But I've also owned some PXC-550s and used my wife's QC 35 ii extensively.Concerns-The first pair I received have a noticeable whooshing or waterfall sound when ANC is on. This is something I have never noticed with Sennheiser or Bose. I will try another pair.-The speak to chat feature way too sensitive. A good idea in principle, but not practical when used in the real world.-Not as comfortable as the QC35 ii - I guess my ears are not small, perhaps medium to large. My ears get warm when these are worn inside for a while.-Adaptive sound control when on seems to cause a lot of beeps and annoying notifications, which can probably be silenced.-Too much is controlled by the app. For example enabling or disabling many of the features.The good stuff.-My initial impression is that they sound great but I have not played with the EQ or base settings etc.-I like that you can take off your earphones and it pauses the music.If I decide to keep these I will update the review.---Edit  - 11/14/2020After receiving and testing my 2nd pair of these headphones, I will unfortunately be returning this pair as well.  First of all they still have a noticeable whooshing sound when NC is on. So I cannot agree that these are best in class NC especially since I don't notice white noise on Bose or Sennheiser. Second of all, they randomly turn off which is extremely annoying. It's like I pressed the power button but I didn't. Overall the  touch controls are unreliable as many have suggested. Third of all, I find that they pinch my head so they are really not that comfortable and definitely not worth the premium that Sony charges for these cans. And no I do not have a large head. I know this based on my baseball cap size.So I have concluded that all the YouTubers who drooled over these headphones simply sold out and were bribed by the lure of free merch. 5 star, my a$$.

Saif,Don't buy it if you are looking for Talking,"If you are looking for calls or talking, don't buy this headset. Not only this any Bluetooth headsets without a separate microphone. Even Sony claims 5 microphones and bla bla bla technology to filter #$#@# sounds from the outside world, it is not working in the real world.You enable the ambient sound then your phone battery will drain completely due to this functionality.If you are looking for the headphone with awesome call quality go for Jabra evolve 75 or evolve 2 85. Which is doing a nice job on all the phone or office calls.If I put on this headset and attend any meeting or even a simple phone call the person on the other side is always saying ""We can't hear you or I can't hear you properly"".Not sure who is architecting the designs, adding a simple microphone as Jabra has it on the Elite2 85 model will be enough for the call requirement.PLEASE NEVER EVER LISTEN TO these REVIEWERS IN YOUTUBE.

Victor gomez,These really work!!,"These headphones have outperformed my expectations. I really had none to begin with, not knowing what NC headphones were. What arrived in the box was nothing short of magic. I have never had a piece of technology so completely shape my entire world like these headphones. They are too good. I recently had to move back into my parents' house to study for college exams and these have helped me so much. I live in a small house with five other people who are not quiet and blare the television. Before these headphones it was a battle to contain myself and just focus on my studying, between loud bursts of laughter, the constant chatter and loud TV. It's been nearly impossible to get anything done. Now with these headphones it's like I live in another house entirely. it truly feels that way. I cannot hear the loud TV at all, and loud voices and slamming doors are reduced to distant voices. I constantly mistake my family for the neighbors or people walking down the street. if it weren't for vibrations, I would hardly know anyone else lived in the house. The headphones came with a numerous function that I didn't think I'd ever use, but oh my god they are the cherry on the sundae. Just by passing my hand over the headphone, ambient noise is amplified and whatever you're listening to is automatically lowered.  They've made it so I'm not completely shut off from the world and i can function within this alternate dimension of noise canceling effectively.  They are gentle and personally i have had no ill effects at all. I can keep them on all day and haven't noticed any pressure. I will say they do take some time to get used to because of how well they work. I can't really explain it. Just imagine some type of black magic is imbued into these things, its honestly like a drug. It's crazy, ten out of ten. Noice cancelling is awesome. Sound quality is pretty average. I mean, music and movies sound great, but I've probable heard better. The noise cancelling is what you buy these for and let me reiterate. It is worth it.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Jessica,Awesome Noise-Cancelling and Comfort for On the Go!,"I have never spent more than $70 on a pair of headphones, so Sony's new XM4 Headphones was a large purchase for me.To give you some context, my main headphones have been the Sony MDR7506 Large Diaphragm Headphones.They've been awesome for delivering balanced sound, creating music and using for my laptop when I'm stationary, but they've never been the best type of headphones to bring with me when I'm on the go or traveling.I've had these headphones for 3 days now, and while I expect more updates in the future via the Sony Headphones app, I've been pleasantly surprised to find how comfortable they are and convenient to use when I'm walking around or simply relaxing in my room.Compared to my previous headphones, if I wore them longer than a couple of hours, my ears and sides of my head would hurt. As a glasses wearer, I was concerned that these headphones would do the same, but they've been awesome so far - I've worn them for 6 hours straight with no ear pain! :)I prefer turning off the Ambient filter setting in the app while I'm at home, since I like to hear what's around me, but once I start traveling again, I'd imagine I'd use it more. The noise-cancelling definitely works, even without the headphones turned on - I almost find it disorienting how quiet everything becomes when I turn the headphones on (I'm used to a lot of background noises in my daily life).In terms of sound quality, I can't say I was amazed. This mostly is because I think I already had a pretty great pair of headphones to begin with, and now with the XM4's I can hear details a bit more thanks to the noise canceling! I haven't experimented much with the equalizer yet within the app, but that's something I would like to update people on as I continue to use them.The only disappointment I have so far with them is the incapability I have with pairing them with my main PC.I checked to make sure my drivers were updated and the headphones themselves, but they seem to have a hard time being detected at all, or they are paired as an ""other device"" on my Windows 10 PC. This could be due to my own doing, as I built the PC myself, and perhaps there is a problem, but nonetheless, I tried to find a solution online but couldn't find one...so I have resorted to using them plugged in, which is a tad disappointing, but I do realize these headphones are more meant for on-the-go then plug and play.Considering this is my first time buying expensive headphones, I want to be honest - I think I may have been better off buying cheaper ones, but at the same time, they do deliver what they said they would - the speak to chat feature is extremely helpful when I'm busy or my hands are full and can't actively touch my phone or headphones (the music or whatever you're listening to is paused and outside voices are amplified so you can hear what you and others are saying). This feature can be disabled in the app, and set to different times in terms of when to turn off. EX: I was speaking to my mom when I was doing the dishes, and I couldn't quite take them off when my hands were wet - music was paused and I could hear what she was saying! :DI'll probably update this as I start using them more when I'm outside the house.I hope this helps you decide if you would like to purchase these headphones.Stay safe out there!",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

John,"Good sound, good NC...multipoint Bluetooth FAIL!","I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II.  I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later).  The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II.  However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.Sound: A-First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II.  Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy.  With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great.  A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality.  The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi.  Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback.  However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.Noise cancelling: A-When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling.  It wasn't present with the XM3.  I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4.  I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely.  The XM3 still has some leakage.  The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better.  The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.Multipoint Bluetooth: FThis was the feature I had been waiting for.  The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once.  FAIL!  I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4.  I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed.  Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated.  So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth.  Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless.  This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device.  However, the way it manages connections is very poor.  I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer.  If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound.  Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio.  I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play.  If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless.  With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode.  They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed.  So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3.  I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them.  With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it.  But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet.  At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for.  I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.Comfort: ACompared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on.  The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.Controls: BI totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls.  Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead.  It's a small annoyance.  On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.In-call: DOne thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking.  Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it.  If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on.  Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated.  Super slow and awkward and unusable.  So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak.  When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day.  Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone.  I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them.  I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this.  Fail.Auto-mute: FSony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking.  Nice in concept - terrible in practice.  I just turned it off and left it off.  If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time.  So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening.  What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying.  So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.Miscellaneous:I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone.  With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot.  It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching.  The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable.  I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great.  Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones.  This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones.  How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use?  It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.Conclusion:All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product.  If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it.  The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3.  Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering.  The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3.  In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark.  I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones.  As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back.  Sadly, they are not as advertised.",2,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
MechEngr,Engineer and former Bose-fanboy Approved!,"I've owned Bose over-ear noise cancelling headphones for the last 5 or so years and always thought they were the best out there. Naturally, when I looked at an upgrade for my Bose QC25's, the Bose 700 series was the obvious choice.The engineer in me, however, required hours of online research before committing to a pair of headphones I'll use for 8+ hours a day.After watching various reviews and comparisons of the best active noise cancelling over-ear headphones, I was surprised to see the latest versions of Sony's headphones beating Bose in some areas of critical importance to me. My use-case for noise-cancelling headphones is for working in a relatively loud environment (SpaceX manufacturing floor) with spacecraft assembly being carried out and engineers rustling and bustling during all hours of the day and night. This environment can be very demanding on a pair of ANC headphones due to the various frequencies and magnitudes of sounds involved. Ultimately, noise cancelling, battery life, and multi-device Bluetooth connectivity became the personal ranking scale when selecting headphones.The Sony's claim 30+ hours of battery life (which I haven't personally validated), ability to connect to my phone and computer wirelessly, and great active noise cancelling.After working with these for a few weeks, I'm super impressed with the technology deployed on these headphones. I did not realize how valuable connecting to two devices can be when jumping between playing music on my iphone and hopping onto microsoft teams calls on my computer.The noise cancelling is EXCELLENT and reduces outside sounds by 95 or so percent. These things are also extremely COMFORTABLE on my big head, which is helpful for wearing these for very long periods of time during 14 hour work days.Overall I highly recommend these headphones if battery life, 2-device connectivity, and great noise cancelling are your motivating factors for buying expensive headphones.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

catamountgapbluescatamountgapblues,Great headphones...but boy are they fragile. (Update November 2021),"TL;DR: Great headphones....but boy are they fragile.The XM4s are excellent headphones. Bose only dreams about being able to match the sound quality and noise cancellation on these. They pass the screaming baby on a plane test with flying colors. They're so comfortable you'll forget that you're wearing them. They were the best headphones I ever had...until they broke.After just over six months of use, I turned the ear cups to lay them flat (something I've done dozens of times), and plastic and metal when flying from pivot point. Flying plastic and metal, not from dropping them or stepping on them, but from folding them as the manufacturer designed to be folded. I found the Customer Service Center to be friendly, but ultimately unhelpful. They referred me to United Radio for repair services, which was quoted as $90 (for shipping and labor), with an additional cost for parts after an assessment. I priced the part I think I'll need through Sony's authorized parts dealer (Encompass) and which runs $120.95, which comes to a grand total of $210.95....when I purchased the headphones for $278.I've never been so glad that I purchased an external warranty in my life. Here's to hoping Asurion comes through, and if not I guess my next pair of headphones will have to be sub-par Bose.(Update 11/2021) Thanks to Asurion I was able to (foolishly) get another pair of XM4 with minimal out of pocket cost; however, after being exceptionally paranoid and treating the second pair of headphones with kid gloves, less than four months later I have a pile of plastic and metal, and a dangling ear cup...again.

However, I do found myself resorting to playing white noise more often than I would like.The sound quality is excellent.  Zero complaints here.The headphones are reasonably comfortable to wear.  Some users have complained that the fit feels a bit 'clamped'.  I would agree, however this sensation doesn't bother me, so not a problem from my point of view.Synthetic leather is used as the contact material.  I would have preferred actual leather as the synthetic material gets a bit sweaty.The app works well, no complaints here.The various 'touch' controls (tap the right headphone twice for example to pause) work well.I bought these headphones in preference to the Bose option because of concerns from many reviewers about the bose app and other aspects of the bose software.  Sony have done their work well here and I'm never annoyed by the software experience.I'm overall pleased with the headphones but believe they are somewhat over-priced and would definitely have preferred leather to be used on the ear-cups rather than synthetic leather.",4,B091CQH6VT,Colour: Blue,SONY,Headphones,

Whirlaway,Mostly great,"UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out.  Based on this experience so far, I'm raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars.  Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about).  I'm not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.I now believe the ""bluetooth stopping for no reason"" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better.  As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes.  As a practical matter, this means you can't sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off.  I've wound up disabling this feature.Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable.  The only reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)UPDATED:  I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy.  Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all).  At other times, there are skips or pops.  While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review.  I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.PROS:1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose.  They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file.  When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world.  I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing.  A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have.  It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a ""feature"" of ANC headphones.2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used.  The ear pieces in particular are outstanding.  I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable.  However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable.  These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on.  I can comfortably wear these for hours.3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well.  I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.CONS:1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either).  The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music.  Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue.  I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file.  I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it.  It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason.  For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.2) Phone call quality -- meh.  Some calls are good, others not so much.  Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality.  However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc.  Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better.  I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on.  However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.).  It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones.  However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have.  I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
N,Great to concentrate and super comfortable,"I get easily distracted by my environment, especially sounds, so I needed noise cancelling headphones. This was my main reason for looking into buying these, so Im not much help when it comes to audio quality specifics, though the sound quality does seem great to me.My AirPod pros are nice and quick to connect and use. The noise cancelling works pretty well since they sit in the ear, but they can get uncomfortable. I wanted over the ear headphones that were noise cancelling, comfortable, could be wired or wireless, and had good sound quality. These Sony ones are exactly what I was looking for.Ive tried so many inexpensive noise cancelling headphones, but they simply didnt work well. I could always hear my surroundings, which would distract from my work and make me far less productive than I couldve been. Sound quality was always meh, and most were either bluetooth or wired when I needed both. My pcs bluetooth isnt great, so I wanted the option to plug and listen, while still being able to use wireless with my devices.While the noise cancelling isnt so perfect that I cant hear anything around me 100%, its enough that when listening to music or whatever audio, it drowns out most noise enough for me to concentrate. Some external noises can still come through that I think are just higher pitched, but these Sony headphones are leaps and bounds better than the others Ive tried, which Id hope for at this price.Theyve improved my ability to complete my work and do tasks so much better for the last few months that Ive had them. Even wearing them in crowded areas has been nice, and Im not trading sound quality for noise cancelling or vice versa.Although theyre expensive, theyve been worth the price for me, and not having to use AirPods all the time has been a huge plus and a nice relief for my ears.Edit to add that I also appreciate that I can have 2 things using the headphones at once. Typically its my phone and tablet, and I can just switch to another registered device easily. Also the microphone is nice for phone calls. Not sure how it sounds for the person on the other end, but must be fine if they can hear me. I dont use it often, just them as regular headphones. Theyre great though.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

The air pods pro are good for size reasons, but they can't perform the same as the over the ear, for obvious reasons. I've been using the Sony for months now. The good parts are fine (not mind blowing) and the bad parts make me want to throw these things through a window.Bad1.  The touch controls are terrible and never do what you want, but will reliably skip tracks or pause when you don't want it to. I figured out how to turn this off and how to adjust the headphones on my head without touching them in the wrong spot. But as far as I know I can't control volume now from the device.2. The Sony lady's ""voice"" that tells you what devices you are connected to drowns out phone calls. If you are on a business call and the bluetooth connects or disconnects to your laptop or phone then she will say ""bluetooth device two is disconnected"" and you can't hear what your colleague is saying. Why would I rather be alerted to a computer connecting than to hear what someone in a business meeting is telling me? Drives me nuts and it happens on every single call and then i have to say I'm sorry I lost you there can you repeat that.3. THEY PAUSE IF YOU LAUGH. Do you ever watch a movie or god forbid listen to a comedy special? Well you better not laugh, because the headphones will pause the media. Talk about ruining the moment, something funny happens and then the headphones just kill it like someone yelled cops are here at a college party, but without the excitement. I find myself watching or listening to things in utter silence, trying to stifle any laughs or noises as if the Germans are hunting me.What a terrible implementation of an idea.Sony made a decent product and then totally ruined it with software.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

Lokeshwar K,Best for music but not for calls,"Ive been using this headphone for almost 10 days now. The sound quality and the bass are great, best in class I would say for this price range.Pros:1. Superior sound quality, good for movies and music2. Best in class ANC3. Excellent battery backup4. Build quality and matte finish are top notch5. Touch controls are very helpful, you can do most of the work without touching your laptop or mobile.Cons:1. The call quality is not up to the mark, the side tone feature is enabled by default and there is no option to switch it off.Sidetone meaning: its an additional or unwanted feature. Which enables you to listen to the environment and your own voice to some extent. Just to ensure you are not shouting during calls.All other brands like JBL and Bose have option to disable this but in Sony its not optional. Irritating most of the times2. The box or the case, congested. You have to get used to bending your headphone every time you put it into the case.3. The charging cable. Very small and not very useful unless you charge your headphone using a power bank.4. The AUX cable doesnt have a mic. For this price range Sony could have easily added a mic in aux.5. The App, quite buggy. Inconsistent connectivity. Sometime even though the phone is connected to headphone the app shows its not connected.6. No option to mute the mic with the touch controls.In spite of so many cons I would still rate this 4 star just for the quality of sound it produces.Note: Buy this if you are music lover. If you are looking for an headphone for office or business calls then I would suggest you can better go for Bose 700.",4,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
kris,The ANC King,"I've been using Bose 700 and Sony Xm3 for quite a time and need to say Sony were the pioneers when it come to ANC and they continue their leagacy with XM4 also. XM4 addresses what XM3 lags, The main thing I missed in my XM3's were dual device connect and it's been addressed here and small additions like speak to chat and touch controls make this my go to ANC period.However I still feel voice calls through Bose is still better than this and hope Sony tweaks it through future OTA.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
J. Glasgow,"Das Gesamtpaket stimmt, alles andere ist nur Jammern auf hohem Niveau","Die Auswahl an BT-Kopfhrern ist heute nahezu erschlagend. Die Auswahl an wirklich guten Kopfhrer dagegen ist �berschaubar, je nach Anspruch und Geldbeutel.In meinem Fundus gibt es mittlerweile auch einige namhafte und stylische Bluetooth-Kopfhrer, die alle um die 100�� gekostet haben und auch alle das gleich Problem haben: sie klingen nicht gut.Aber was macht der SONY WH-1000XM4 jetzt soviel besser und was bietet er dem Kufer f�r derzeit knapp 245��?Geliefert wird der Kopfhrer in einer schnen Schachtel. Darin findet man:�� Reise-Case�� Kopfhrer WH-1000XM4�� kurzes USB-C auf USB-A Ladekabel�� 3,5mm Klinkenkabel�� Flugzeug-Adapter 2x 3,5mm KlinkeIch habe mir die KH in der Farbe Midnight Blue gekauft, wobei ich mir zuerst nicht sicher war. Nun bin ich echt froh mich gegen das schnde Schwarz entschieden zu haben, denn das Blau sieht fantastisch aus. Es hat einen leichten Schimmer und ist schn dezent. Auch die rosgoldenen Akzente sich sehr gelungen.F�r die Verwendung unter Android und iOS empfiehlt sich die SONY Headphones App zu laden. Beim ersten Verbinden wird einem diese auch direkt vorgeschlagen. �ber die App lassen sich smtliche Features wie NC, EQ usw einstellen. Auch lsst sich �ber die App zB die Systemsprache auf Deutsch anpassen (Sprachansagen zB beim ein- und ausschalten). Wirklich notwendig ist das allerdings nicht, da die englischen Ansagen selbsterklrend sind und vorallem das Setup auf Deutsch sehr lange dauert f�r meinen Geschmack.Gekoppelt wird der KH entweder �ber Bluetooth (er ist auch NFC-fhig) oder klassisch �ber 3,5mm Klinke. Digital-Audio �ber den USB-C Anschluss unterst�tzt der XM4 leider nicht.Besonderheiten an diesem Bluetooth-Kopfhrer:�� Active Noise Cancelling�� Touch Bedienung�� Speak-to-Chat Funktion�� TrageerkennungDas Noise Cancelling ist mit eines der besten, welches ich bisher testen konnte. Auch kann man die Umgebungsgerusche einschalten, so dass man mehr von seiner Umwelt mitbekommt. Hier finde ich aber, dass zB die Apple AirPods Pro etwas besser performen.Wirklich praktisch finde ich die Speak-to-Chat Funktion. Der Kopfhrer erkennt die eigene Stimme, und das relativ zuverlssig, und unterbricht die Wiedergabe. Auch die Trageerkennung ist einfach genial, man kennt dies zB auch wieder von den AirPods. Man nimmt den KH ab und die Wiedergabe stoppt automatisch. Beim Aufsetzen wird wieder an der vorherigen Stelle fortgesetzt.Im Alltag hat sich f�r mich auch die Touch-Bedienung als echtes Super-Feature heraus gestellt. Anfangs war ich skeptisch, aber mit der ersten Verwendung war die Skepsis schon dahin. Das Touchpad arbeitet genau und es kommt fast zu keinen Fehleingaben. Knpfe gibt es nur f�r EIN/AUS und die Einstellung des ANC.Ebenfalls sinnvoll f�r den Alltag ist das Hardcase f�r den KH. Das ist super verarbeitet und bietet, trotz kompakter Gre, f�r alles seinen Platz. Smtliches mitgeliefertes Zubehr kann darin aufbewahrt werden. Und vor allem ist der Kopfhrer im Rucksack oder der Reisetasche vor Beschdigungen gesch�tzt.�� Aber wie klingt der XM4?Super, einfach genial was SONY hier geleistet hat. Der Kopfhrer klingt auch bei geringer Lautstrke sehr gut und mit steigendem Pegel werden auch die Bsse und Mitten immer prgnanter, aber nie zu derb. Auch kann man �ber den EQ in der App noch einiges aus dem KH heraus kitzeln. Hier macht sich meiner Meinung nach der veranschlagte Preis am meisten bemerkbar. Du bekommst was du bezahlst, das ist wirklich so.Auch bei lngerem Tragen wird der XM4 nie unangenehm. Er ist relativ leicht und der Anpressdruck der Ohrmuscheln ist sehr leicht. Dennoch sitzt der Hrer sicher auf dem Kopf.Also? F�r mich bietet dieser Kopfhrer ein gutes Gesamtpaket zu einem fairen Preis. Wer Wert auf guten Klang und ein qualitativ hochwertiges Package legt, ist beim SONY WH-1000XM4 durchaus gut aufgehoben.",5,B091CQH6VT,Colour: Blue,SONY,Headphones,
Kindle Customer,"JUNK on Windows, otherwise great sound/ANC but ok functionality and poor fit/comfort.","I can't get these to work properly in Windows 10.  This is with bluetooth 4.0, updated drivers and a history of using Samsung Level On headphones with no issues.  When connected to PC it just stutters and cuts in and out, completely unusable.  This is using them as headphones in playback mode.  If I use them as a headset, which is meant for phone calls and conferencing, then I can actually get them to work but they sound very tinny and the volume is very low.  In researching I see this is a common issue with the prior model XM3's and there are various fixes ranging from turning off headset mode to playing with the drivers, I tried all of them and none worked.  After several hours of research and seeing how many others didn't resolve this on the XM3's I am about to give up and just return these.Here is the heartbreaker, using these on my Android phone and they sound superb, perfect, no stutter or cutting out.  I downloaded the app and was able to tweak them to sound even better.  But again this does nothing for using them on a PC.One of the features I was most excited about was using these on 2 devices at a time, but it's a mixed bag at best.  You have to manually switch them in the app, or turn the connection on/off on the device which is just as much of a pain as any other bluetooth  headset without this function.  The Android phone seems to be unable to connect back to them many times and I have to go to bluetooth settings and manually connect.The ANC function is just amazing, I have my home office in a finished basement and have all kinds of furnace/fan and overhead footstep sounds, but with ANC on I heard zero of the furnace/fan, and the overhead footsteps were dampened quite a bit.  My main reason to get these was for the ANC and I wasn't disappointed.  One issue is that the left earphone has a hiss which sounds like the noise cancellation is a bit more aggressive, it's only noticeable when playing stuff at low or no volume.  Not necessarily a deal breaker, but makes the function seem unfinished or faulty and spoils the perfection of the ANC otherwise.Fit: These fit oddly, they are too large for my head, and I have a pretty large head.  Most headphones are small on me, but these, even shortened all the way, still sit slightly below my ears.  I can place the top band towards the front of my head to correct this, but it takes away from the comfort.  The earphones themselves are not as comfortable as I hoped they would be based on reviews. One reason I was upgrading from the Samsung Level On's is because the Level On's earpieces are kind of small and caused fatigue on my ears after a few hours.  While the Sony's earpieces are larger, I feel the way they sit on your head will make them just as fatiguing, maybe worse as they are fairly heavy.  The top band doesn't have suspension system as I would expect with something this expensive, just some foam.So overall I wanted to love these, and I do except for the fact that I cannot get them to work on a Windows 10 PC.  Judging by the plethora of issues I found in searching for this issue with the XM3's it seems I'm not alone.  Unfortunately, regardless of how good they are, that's useless for me if I can't even use them and I have to rate them at 1 star.  Will most likely be returning these unless I can find a solution.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,
Zenma,A Solid Upgrade,"I had the 1000XM3, which unfortunately broke when the headband snapped. That fragility, along with the poor voice call quality, made me slightly resentful of the price I paid for them. Sony was great enough to replace it with a new one, which I decided to resell and use part of proceeds to upgrade to these guys.So far these work great! I'm still concerned about the durability, but I'll also only be using these guys for walks and runs around the city for the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that mitigates the risk of damage.Sound quality is still great, I'd like to do a side by side test to gauge the difference of the DSEE modes, but I've left it on without an issue. The noise cancellation is terrific, and finally, voice calls are functional (I'm pretty sure it denoises the other caller as well, which means their phone's denoising is mixed in with Sony's. The result is usable, but not crisp and full-bodied sound like I'd like. But they're voice calls so I'll take what I can get.I'll always recommend these to folks, though not necessarily over the Bose alternatives since I haven't heard those myself.These are terrific all-around, and for someone who wants to chat handless on a call, this finally pushes the 1000XM series into a must-have.",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

Aidan Torrence,The Bluetooth Dual Sync is literally horrible,"I quickly upgraded from the SONY WH-1000XM3 when I found out that this device can pair to multiple devices at once.  That sounded amazing, and I was really looking forward, as I use bluetooth headphones to connect to both my phone and my computer.From day 1, I have had nothing but horrendous issues with the bluetooth dual-pairing.Just in general, it fails to do its job.  You cannot just go from the computer to the iphone and vice versa.  I spend so much time fiddling with the controls to get back between the computer and the iphone.  I will have to change to a different audio instrument on the computer before it will sync back with the iphone.But even worse, it just randomly unpairs like constantly as I'm listening to music and podcasts on my phone.  Like constantly.  And then it takes 5 minutes to figure out how to get it to pair back up.It's just terrible.Sound quality is great.  They are more comfortable than the 3.But call quality is also just plain bad.  You cannot use them as a headset like you can with the Bose 700.  I cannot tell you how many times I hear that people cannot understand me while I'm using them as a headset and it is so embarrassing.I really want to like these headphones, but they're making me go crazy.",1,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

George Wilkins,It's good but has some annoyances.,"Just little things that make these headphones get on your nerves a little bit.Like the voice that tells when it powers on or off being too loud for me and doesn't seem to have a way to turn it down. The feature where you take it off your head to pause being inconsistant as I've come back a few times to find my music still playing. The fact they get unbearably hot while wearing them and charging them at the same time. The fact I have this issue where once I pair them to something they won't show up on other devices bluetooth pairing modes unless I unpair them from everything and pair everything I want to use it with at the same time. Also, I wasn't able to get the app to work on my phone.Other than that, the noise cancelling was amazing for my flights from the UK to Australia and back and I didn't have to charge them for the whole flight so battery life is amazing too. They're definitely not balenced and have heaps of bass but I got used to that. They're also useful at home using them with my laptop or desktop as you can't hear the fan noise.Overall, I will keep using them and just have to live with the minor annoyances I have with the product.",4,B091CQH6VT,Colour: Blue,SONY,Headphones,
ApasisApasis,If Two Heads Are Better Than One...,"Then you get two of them. Yes, I had many brands and models to choose from, but in the end I had to get a second pair of 1000XM4. You can't make this stuff up!You may be wanting to say: But you can only use one of them at a time.  And I'll say: But that's what you think.Everyone is saying how good these headphones really are, but don't be fooled by that - try it for yourselves. Sure, it has upgraded padding, lightweight, easy on the ears, and subtle design improvements over its predecessor, but that's about where the difference ends - at least from a visual perspective anyway.I can tell you it sounds great, but that's to be expected from a brand new pair of premium headphones anyway. Listening to them I was not blown away. I didn't get it... until I went back to listen to my old pair for comparison. WOW! Only then could I truly appreciate the immense acoustic separation that the 1000XM4 fields! Perhaps it was the AI upscaling my MP3 to a higher level or perhaps it was just relying on it laurels as a superb pair of high quality headphones. Whatever it was, WOW!Perhaps the first sign that these were truly a magnificent piece of engineering, was when I put them on. The noise cancelling alone seem to create the feeling that I was in another world, the current world (of sounds) being blotted out. And then the music track dropped.However, the only real issue that I had was that I wasn't able to enjoy the 360 Reality Audio. I cannot understand why these features were not built into the headphone so that everyone could enjoy it anywhere, instead of a limited subset of people relying on a few less popular websites like Tidal, and restricted to a handful of pre-selected songs. This is not good. People have vast libraries and their own user-created audio files that cannot utilize this feature. Moreover, even Apple or Spotify steaming service cannot access this acoustic engine.One school of thought is for Sony to use AI to split the audio into several objects and place them around the user in real time, creating a crisp, immersive audio experience. And since custom settings are possible, the AI could play the same song in several different ways or move the objects around to create a real-live effect. In other words - simulated live concert in a headphone.""Better than the artist intended.""This must be what Sony intends for in 2022, or how else can there be a WH-1000XM5?",5,B0863TXGM3,Colour: Black,SONY,Headphones,

Steve Hall,Better than I thought.,On opening the Amazon packaging I was amused to see that one slightly screwed up piece of paper was all that was deemed by the supplier as sufficient for protection .When the headphones are revealed in the see through Boat box the next shock is that the rather classy looking beige colour as shown is actually a very cheap looking pale yellow. The overall feel is very cheap and flimsy so the lightness which is treated as a plus point is in fact the opposite as it gives the impression of poor quality.And so expecting the worst soundwise I firef them up and put them on. To my surprise they sounded pretty good with a bit of eq adjustment at the player end.So its minus a star for build and misleading colour but overall for this price they do the job quite well.

The entire thing is well cushioned. It is comfortable on the ears. No pressure on the ears like u just have to put it off even if u don't want to. The ears will sweat a little it's true but that is because they cover the entire year. The headband does not feel heavy at all on the head. There is no problems with the connectivity at all. It only took a few seconds to connect to my iPad air 3 and my realme 5 pro (mentioned the model so that angone having these model can buy it worryfree)Second the sound. The treble is a bit low but the base is on point. It comes both with a 3.5mm aux. So playing Pubg with this is no issue. With Bluetooth connectivity u will find latency but with the wire, footsteps and everything are clear af. There is noise cancellation but don't expect like those of bose.

In one year all the cloths  given above the coushin of the headphone or whatever it is called came off. Sometimes it automatically get disconnected then you have to manually connect it again. Talking about the battery it is pretty good. Battery performance didn't depleted much in this much of time. Sound quality is also good you will get enough bass. Only problem is that mic is not so good and Bluetooth sometimes get disconnected automatically and coushins are not so good. Sound and battery life is good. I would recommend if you have budget under 2000 then definitely go for this one unless you want to record your voice using this headphone. You can use this headphone for calling. Also If you are a hardcore music lover the. You may get little disappointment bass is good but not that much and after one year the bass has become less.,4,B0856HNLDK,Colour: Red | Style Name: 2023,BOAT,Headphones,

But device showed no problems. Sound is clear, balanced, not very hogh but enough bass, good battery backup, charges faster, aux is available. Disadvantage is you can't fold it.

Tanuj Soni Tanuj Soni ,Great Headphone with some inconvenience,"I have used many headphones form Boat and other brands and I can simply say I love the Sound quality AND Loudness ( I don't use Soundcore life Q10 because Loudness is not upto the mark). Now to problems:1.Microphone is Mid (Rokerz 510 is better but it's sound leaks!)2.If you are like me, You would prefer loud and comfortable headsets. Boat Rockerz 510 is by far the most comfortable headphones I have  ever used. 550 is fine.3.By far the most annoying thing about this headphone is ""Maximum Volume"" Announcement every time I turn up the volume. Someone please tell me how to turn this off or it's not possible.Overall It is a Great Headphone with superb and the BEST Sound Quality and Loudness with fine comfort and I do recommend it for the price. Don't go for Boult (Extremely Horrible products) or Soundcore (More price for less Loudness). I can recommend Rockerz 510 as they are Super comfortable and are cheaper (Sound Leakage is a bit of a problem)",4,B0856HNLDK,Colour: Red | Style Name: 2023,BOAT,Headphones,

Design is lit as Hell.Sound quality is lit with Bass, little bit of mid and also treble.A bit heavy in weight.No lags in connectivity.Comfortable to wear, as ear cuffs are soft.After long hours of use, heats up the ear but it doesn't matter if you are in the air conditioning.Worth every Penny.

Bass quality is very nice, comfortable on ears and very comfortable adjustment to need. The bluetooth connectivity lag is there of about 2 seconds but with an AUX it works fantastic. The charge lasts for days on 1 full battery. Charge time is also good.The 3 things i would like to point out are:1. The mic doesn't work well, person on call and on VC listen more of the outside rather than your voice.2. The noise isolation isn't on Mark. The headphones let in outside voice if you're not listening something on full volume.3. The headphone material is rather soft to get cuts, so be careful with that.Other than these 3, works well.

Rafe,The review you're looking for...,"Here's everything you need to know.Pros:* Perfect fit* Not heavy* Decent bass* Beautiful design* Quite comfortable* Awsome battery life* No noticeable latency* Very capable to get loud* Crystal clear sound quality* Ear cups fully cover the ears* Easy to launch Google Assistant* Great connectivity (Bluetooth 5.0)* You won't hear anybody while playing music* Blocks about 80% of surrounding sound when not playing musicCons:* Would've been very convenient if it had a USB-C port for charging* Mic quality is average but I don't expect any better from headphones which aren't gaming headsets* Coming from Zakk H04 Blaze which are on-ear headphones, the bass is a little less compared to on-ear headphones* Fancy LED lights like H04 Blaze would've made it look better in dark but that has nothing to do with the headphones itselfConclusion:Bought it in a sale for 1500 INR. Good value for money and is worth buying even for the regular price of 2000 INR. Go for the red color, you'll truly admire it, the black one is quite dull. The sound quality is amazingly nice and these headphones are very capable of producing good bass. If you really like a lot of bass, use an equalizer and you'll be pleased with it. These are not active noise canceling headphones and I know that, but the passive noise cancellation is suprisingly good.

KushagraKushagra,Worth every penny and you won't regret,"Got it for ��1499 in great condition. After multiple researches between boat 370, 400, 450, 510 and 600,I had ordered boat 510 in big billion days but after a week my sight came over this 550 which was something I hadn't heard till date. Without wasting much of time, I cancelled 510 and ordered this one. And it's working very well. All the above-mentioned headphones would be great in their price bracket and you'd remain satisfied with your buy. Let me tell you a little about this one now:-Pros:-1. Sound quality great and much clear....2. For bass you should thank 50 mm headphone driver which is best among all boat headphones. This driver is in boat 510 as well.3. Battery life is great and you may not complain about it. Battery life in single charge is around 16-18 hours or tbh 20 hours as well!4. Passive noise cancellation is great and will surely satisfy your need.5. I found it comfortable to wear for longer durations too. Good cushions are provided everywhere you need. Your ears will easily fit in the earcups.6. I didn't found it that much heavy probably bacause of plastic body, which is common in this price bracket.Cons:-1. I didn't found many cons here but small things can be fixed like, the mic feels a little problem to catch sounds of low amplitude/ soft sounds/ whispers. But you may not find it too problematic. It's okay.2. While playing games like call of duty mobile, I found a delay of nearly 0.5 seconds in sound and light (the actions in the game). There was no delay while doing normal works like calling, video watching, music listening. I think such delay while gaming appear on other headphones as well.Conclusion:- So while summing I'm sure that you won't regret this buy. Go for it.",5,B0856HNLDK,Colour: Red | Style Name: 2023,BOAT,Headphones,
Jeremiah l.,Uncomfortable but good sound quality and keeps giving problems in audio.,"i have been using the headphones for 5 days now, some pointers to know are:1) it can fall if you use it while working out so you have to be very delicate with it's use.2) there is a 30second delay in the power on and connection time.3) your ears overheat and become sweaty even if you're using it in an air conditioned atmosphere4) the sound quality is good but not going to sweep you off your feet.5) the Bluetooth in my device is very faulty but it may not be a problem for everyone. When connected it gives broken audio, etc.6) the microphone captures more of the background audio rather than the speaker, i have found this problem in all my Boat devices, so the company needs to change their microphone dealer and quality to solve this issue.there are a few other minor problems but overall there are much better products availble in the price range but this isn't as bad.",4,B0BVRGZ9FV,Colour: Green | Style Name: 2023,BOAT,Headphones,

Also the comfort level is not as much as I had expected, despite the fact that it is 'over ears'. You can't wear it for long hrs. Take some rest & put them on again.Sound quality is great.

The sound quality is pathetic and absolute waste for such a high cost it's doesn't even sound clear forget about crystal clear!The mids and high are mixed and muffled sounds like any Chinese headphones under 500. now talking about the bass wait a min who are you! The only talking is done when there is something�! There is absolutely no bass at all in the headphones � therefore boat rockerzz 550 is an absolute waste!Thank God I have returned these on the same day I mean next day and got my refund!Therefore I will never recommend any of you to waste 1.5k for only show-off!",1,B0856HNLDK,Colour: Red | Style Name: 2023,BOAT,Headphones,

It was reared at the side but the headphones were good.Overall it's a good but not the best product. Don't expect something magical, although it's comfortable and connects the second you turn it on.(Overall - 7.5/10)It looks good and stylish. I ordered red one because they look better than black one..Build quality- 7/10They are made of plastic so I don't expect much yet they look sturdy to stick for as long as a year. That's what durability a product of this budget could possibly offer! The ear cups are not displayed from inner angle in the photographs. They look like a low quality as the stitches can be seen and they are filthy and sensitive. So it may get damaged with rough use.Sound- 8/10It lacks the bass I want , I tried equalizers but it just gives out limited bass.This time boat did care about mids and highs a little so its overall balanced sound.That means not much bass and not much treble, just a balanced sound.Connectivity- 9/10They connect instantly but it did paused a youtube video I was watching so maybe it's normal in bt headsets !Comfort- 9/10It feels like it's not even there.The only issue is sweat, when you wear it for a long time, you will sweat but sweat is indispensable in headphones.Noise cancellation- 8/10As already mentioned there that its physical cancellation through a sound resistant material.Battery life- 8/10It's been a day since it arrived so I can't say much about it . I received it with 80 percent battery. And used it for around an hour and it got drained to 70 percent but it totally depends upon usage that on what volume you use it . I used it at 75-85 percent so it drained that way.Lags-I dint notice any lag so far and didn't tried it on pubg so can't tell about it. But one thing for sure you will hear footsteps in pubg for sure !Don't expect a punchy bass, it's normal as advertised ""HD immmersive sound"".I've been using boat products for 2 years and these are good for low budget headphones!",4,B0856HNLDK,Colour: Red | Style Name: 2023,BOAT,Headphones,

Sahil Gupta,Good headphone for price. But bass is incredibly higher than average though.,"If you don't wanna read my thoughts about these headphones, I have written OVERALL CONCLUSION at the bottom for those who just wanna get to the point of my review.I cannot say this one of the best headphones I have ever heard. But for the price I can say this is a very good value for money headphone. But if you are like me, an audiophile obsessed with high quality stuff. Then these headphones would not really impress you.However, I WOULD say these headphones have a Bass much higher than headphones I have heard even than the Sony MDR-XB450 EXTRA BASS.I can tell you one thing, if you listen to bass heavy and don't really mind a sound quality that may sound bellow average, then these headphones would satisfy you very much!I wouldn't recommend using these headphones on a phone unless your phone has a very good DAC, which basically means a good sound card, which would give you the best out of these headphones.However, let me explain why exactly I feel these headphones could have been better. The main thing is the sound quality. I could hear some vocals getting a bit underwhelmed, and the overall quality of the sound wasn't too good. Now I'm not saying thats unacceptable considering the price. For the price these headphones would definitely blow you away.But I bought these headphones as a spare, portable and durable solution for video editing. Now I am disappointed by the overall sound quality, but they do the job well enough, and I cannot complain about the bass. The bass in these headphones are absolutely incredible and almost a steal for this price.The 40mm drivers allow the sound of these headphones to sound much wider and more fuller than you would get in a pair of earphones.OVERALL CONCLUSION:Buy these headphones if you want amazing vibrating incredible thumping bass. Good portability since this headphone folds up which is a nice feature. It has good build quality, and feels very sturdy, has an in-built microphone and has decent level of noise isolation/comfort.Overall - a very good buy for the price you pay, and a steal price if you are a bass lover.***Remember that you WILL need an AMP or a good in-built sound card in your device in order to get the best out of these headphones. ***",4,B078W65FJ7,Colour: Pearl White | Style Name: Bassheads 900 | Pattern Name: Headphones,BOAT,Headphones,

Orjun,Too Tight on the Ears,"I bought these for my Son. Both of us use the headphones.The sound quality for the price range is excellent. It got a good Bass, treble could have been sharper. However the biggest issue with this headset, is that it's too tight on the ears ( and I dont have a very big face ).After about 5 mins, your ears start to hurt ( literally hurt ).So while, the sound may be good, it's of no use when you cannot use the head set for more than 10 minutes at a stretch.2 stars only for the reason that these headsets are practically un-usable due to being too tight.",2,B078W65FJ7,Colour: Pearl White | Style Name: Bassheads 900 | Pattern Name: Headphones,BOAT,Headphones,

Talking about the noise cancellation feature, it indeed cancels out the exterior noise, I had put it on my ears, played a song and simultaneously played another song on my TV, I really could not hear my TV's sound. I liked the design and it feels quite appealing.Now I have two problems with the headphones firstly being it cannot be put on for a longer period of time. Adds a little bit of stress over your ears and they start to ache not much though but that's quite a concern. Second being the length of the wire, it's very long and often it annoys you because it doesn't get fit into pockets and all quite easily. Overall a quality product at this rate and I recommend to buy anyone who's interested and willing to give a shot at buying this headphones.Packaging of the product can be much better.

For bass lover go for this . 3.5mm jack is head is quite good and durable. And having call receiving button is grt need of daliy use. Delivery at my location was  done in time. Durability i hv doubt as it is light in weight. I can say with rough use it may hv chances of breaking.

A SINGHAL,"Stopped working in 1 month, Service center is pathetic,","Sound quality and looks is very good, So purchased 3 headphones as such of same model.One headphone stopped working in 1 month itself. Taken it to Ghaziabad Service center as it said 1 year warranty.Service center staff inspected it visually and took it inside for verification. Later on returned saying that is has a vertical cut mark on wire some 1 feet from jack. There was no cut when it was given to them and its obvious they made a slight peel cut on wire to void warranty. That too its just a small peel mark on insulation which cant damage inside wires, still they have not entertained warranty.Such experience was not expected from company like boat!!!!  product is good till it works, dont buy seeing warranty support....because its just a eye wash",1,B078W65FJ7,Colour: Pearl White | Style Name: Bassheads 900 | Pattern Name: Headphones,BOAT,Headphones,

Rott,This is not a bass head phone,"Cons:1. This is definitely not a bass head set, it's low medium bass.2. This is more a treble responsive headset3. Further this is not an Active noise cancellation headset, infact no lt even noise isolation headset.4. The bass response is aggressive on certain mid to high frequency bass range which gives a pretty harsh thud on your ear.5. I have a low end 10 driver BA, which is atleast 10 times better with bass and noise isolation..Pros1. Pretty cheap on Amazon in the pricing (pocket friendly)2. The metal connector with spring is premium quality.3. The overall product build and feel is premium.4. The mic is pretty responsive and works well.5. It can be used for long conf calls as the material is soft on the outer ear and it's adjustable.6 the gauge of wire used is extremely thick and tangle free which is great at this price.7 There is no noise induced by brushing the wire against fabric or ones body which is a plus.",4,B078W65FJ7,Colour: Pearl White | Style Name: Bassheads 900 | Pattern Name: Headphones,BOAT,Headphones,

Utsarika C.Utsarika C.,Rockerz 550 Rocks!!!!!!! (Detailed review),"Got this on the prime day exclusive sale. For Rs. 1498 u cant get a better deal than this.First i will come to the build. The entire thing is well cushioned. It is comfortable on the ears. No pressure on the ears like u just have to put it off even if u don't want to. The ears will sweat a little it's true but that is because they cover the entire year. The headband does not feel heavy at all on the head. There is no problems with the connectivity at all. It only took a few seconds to connect to my iPad air 3 and my realme 5 pro (mentioned the model so that angone having these model can buy it worryfree)Second the sound. The treble is a bit low but the base is on point. It comes both with a 3.5mm aux. So playing Pubg with this is no issue. With Bluetooth connectivity u will find latency but with the wire, footsteps and everything are clear af. There is noise cancellation but don't expect like those of bose. Obvio the price point does vary a lot. But for this range this is too good. I am satisfied with my purchase to the highest point.

Kunal KumarKunal Kumar,Review after using for one year!!,I have been using this headphone for a year now. In one year all the cloths  given above the coushin of the headphone or whatever it is called came off. Sometimes it automatically get disconnected then you have to manually connect it again. Talking about the battery it is pretty good. Battery performance didn't depleted much in this much of time. Sound quality is also good you will get enough bass. Only problem is that mic is not so good and Bluetooth sometimes get disconnected automatically and coushins are not so good. Sound and battery life is good. I would recommend if you have budget under 2000 then definitely go for this one unless you want to record your voice using this headphone. You can use this headphone for calling. Also If you are a hardcore music lover the. You may get little disappointment bass is good but not that much and after one year the bass has become less.,4,B0856HNLDK,Colour: Red | Style Name: 2023,BOAT,Headphones,

Someone please tell me how to turn this off or it's not possible.Overall It is a Great Headphone with superb and the BEST Sound Quality and Loudness with fine comfort and I do recommend it for the price.

Good value for money and is worth buying even for the regular price of 2000 INR. Go for the red color, you'll truly admire it, the black one is quite dull. The sound quality is amazingly nice and these headphones are very capable of producing good bass. If you really like a lot of bass, use an equalizer and you'll be pleased with it.

KushagraKushagra,Worth every penny and you won't regret,"Got it for ��1499 in great condition. After multiple researches between boat 370, 400, 450, 510 and 600,I had ordered boat 510 in big billion days but after a week my sight came over this 550 which was something I hadn't heard till date. Without wasting much of time, I cancelled 510 and ordered this one. And it's working very well. All the above-mentioned headphones would be great in their price bracket and you'd remain satisfied with your buy. Let me tell you a little about this one now:-Pros:-1. Sound quality great and much clear....2. For bass you should thank 50 mm headphone driver which is best among all boat headphones. This driver is in boat 510 as well.3. Battery life is great and you may not complain about it. Battery life in single charge is around 16-18 hours or tbh 20 hours as well!4. Passive noise cancellation is great and will surely satisfy your need.5. I found it comfortable to wear for longer durations too. Good cushions are provided everywhere you need. Your ears will easily fit in the earcups.6. I didn't found it that much heavy probably bacause of plastic body, which is common in this price bracket.Cons:-1. I didn't found many cons here but small things can be fixed like, the mic feels a little problem to catch sounds of low amplitude/ soft sounds/ whispers. But you may not find it too problematic. It's okay.2. While playing games like call of duty mobile, I found a delay of nearly 0.5 seconds in sound and light (the actions in the game). There was no delay while doing normal works like calling, video watching, music listening. I think such delay while gaming appear on other headphones as well.Conclusion:- So while summing I'm sure that you won't regret this buy.

Jeremiah l.,Uncomfortable but good sound quality and keeps giving problems in audio.,"i have been using the headphones for 5 days now, some pointers to know are:1) it can fall if you use it while working out so you have to be very delicate with it's use.2) there is a 30second delay in the power on and connection time.3) your ears overheat and become sweaty even if you're using it in an air conditioned atmosphere4) the sound quality is good but not going to sweep you off your feet.5) the Bluetooth in my device is very faulty but it may not be a problem for everyone. When connected it gives broken audio, etc.6) the microphone captures more of the background audio rather than the speaker, i have found this problem in all my Boat devices, so the company needs to change their microphone dealer and quality to solve this issue.there are a few other minor problems but overall there are much better products availble in the price range but this isn't as bad.",4,B0BVRGZ9FV,Colour: Green | Style Name: 2023,BOAT,Headphones,

Simon_Gomes,A big disappointment and a total WASTE!,"Ordered this product on 8th of November and got it delivered on the same day through fast delivery for extra 150rs.Packaging was good and decent no complaints to Amazon's service.Now talking about the product:COMFORT: so basically these headphones are most suitable for small headed people therefore perfect for me! The cushion was decent didn't find any issue while wearing itBUILD AND DESIGN: the build quality is kind of okay ish,it's neither that durable nor that weak.Talking about the design which is the main highlighted part of this product which is actually eye-catching and looks premium though it's a plastic build, I ain't gonna say much about physical attributes let's get into the main pointSOUND QUALITY:A huge disappointment from such a well knowned brand(boat) even I own many other products of this brand like bt speakers , earphones. The sound quality is pathetic and absolute waste for such a high cost it's doesn't even sound clear forget about crystal clear!The mids and high are mixed and muffled sounds like any Chinese headphones under 500. now talking about the bass wait a min who are you! The only talking is done when there is something�! There is absolutely no bass at all in the headphones � therefore boat rockerzz 550 is an absolute waste!Thank God I have returned these on the same day I mean next day and got my refund!Therefore I will never recommend any of you to waste 1.5k for only show-off!",1,B0856HNLDK,Colour: Red | Style Name: 2023,BOAT,Headphones,

AyushAyush,Over-all a GOOD product,"I got it for Rs=1298 �� in prime day sale.Placed order on 6 august and received it on 8 august .Package wasn't upto the mark though. It was reared at the side but the headphones were good.Overall it's a good but not the best product. Don't expect something magical, although it's comfortable and connects the second you turn it on.(Overall - 7.5/10)It looks good and stylish. I ordered red one because they look better than black one..Build quality- 7/10They are made of plastic so I don't expect much yet they look sturdy to stick for as long as a year. That's what durability a product of this budget could possibly offer! The ear cups are not displayed from inner angle in the photographs. They look like a low quality as the stitches can be seen and they are filthy and sensitive. So it may get damaged with rough use.Sound- 8/10It lacks the bass I want , I tried equalizers but it just gives out limited bass.This time boat did care about mids and highs a little so its overall balanced sound.That means not much bass and not much treble, just a balanced sound.Connectivity- 9/10They connect instantly but it did paused a youtube video I was watching so maybe it's normal in bt headsets !Comfort- 9/10It feels like it's not even there.The only issue is sweat, when you wear it for a long time, you will sweat but sweat is indispensable in headphones.Noise cancellation- 8/10As already mentioned there that its physical cancellation through a sound resistant material.Battery life- 8/10It's been a day since it arrived so I can't say much about it . I received it with 80 percent battery. And used it for around an hour and it got drained to 70 percent but it totally depends upon usage that on what volume you use it . I used it at 75-85 percent so it drained that way.Lags-I dint notice any lag so far and didn't tried it on pubg so can't tell about it. But one thing for sure you will hear footsteps in pubg for sure !Don't expect a punchy bass, it's normal as advertised ""HD immmersive sound"".I've been using boat products for 2 years and these are good for low budget headphones!",4,B0856HNLDK,Colour: Red | Style Name: 2023,BOAT,Headphones,

Over the ear headphones provide a next level comfort. The bass is ok. As many people said, the headphones add too much bass, no it doesn't. It reporducee sound just as it is. Bass is there where needed. But u do need to listen to high volumes to enjoy. It has audio leakage issues. Battery life excellent. But when it reaches 30% battery, it keeps saying low battery which is a big turndown for me. Anyways mine lasted 6 days with 6 to 7 hrs of usage at 70% volume upto 30% battery.A good purchase if u get it at this price.

Steve Hall,Better than I thought.,On opening the Amazon packaging I was amused to see that one slightly screwed up piece of paper was all that was deemed by the supplier as sufficient for protection .When the headphones are revealed in the see through Boat box the next shock is that the rather classy looking beige colour as shown is actually a very cheap looking pale yellow. The overall feel is very cheap and flimsy so the lightness which is treated as a plus point is in fact the opposite as it gives the impression of poor quality.And so expecting the worst soundwise I firef them up and put them on. To my surprise they sounded pretty good with a bit of eq adjustment at the player end.So its minus a star for build and misleading colour but overall for this price they do the job quite well. We're not talking top class here but I don't think you'll get much better in this price range just for casual listening or out and about use.,4,B086671ZSR,Colour: Hazel Beige | Style Name: 15 Hours | Pattern Name: Headphones,BOAT,Headphones,

Compared to Boat JBL's bass is not that great but you get use to it. The sound quality is amazing. The comfort of the padding is good and will take shape according to your ears in no time. I have used them while travelling in buses metros, local trains all swrating but there is not a single issue in it's performance. Even tho I'm not a unboxer but the unboxing experience was good.

Unterwegs ist sind die Teile auch top, jedoch wackeln sie schnell und rutschen von den Ohren.

Es m�s, he llegado a usarlos para sesiones en salas peque�as o en casa, dando una calidad excelente, la verdad.El acabado es de pl�stico y bien acabado. Las almohadillas de los auriculares son de ""piel pl�stica"", no creo que tengan una gran durabilidad, pero por el precio que tiene es m�s que suficiente.El cable incluye micrfono (y se oye a buena calidad), e incluye un botn para activar Siri/Google, y funciona perfectamente.El �nico pero que le veo es a la construccin del cable.

La comodidad es buena (si te gustan los auriculares supraaurales, va seg�n el gusto) , el acolchado se adapta bien a la oreja y aislan muy bien del ruido exterior.En cuanto al sonido, lo primero que te das cuenta es que los graves son bastante notables, incluso demasiado para mi gusto porque las frecuencias agudas son m�s tenues, lo que te obliga a tener que ecualizar. Tanto en mvil como en pc he notado lo mismo, quiz�s m�s notable en mvil. Pero una vez ecualizado, el sonido es muy bueno.

Fantasia-E-Sonata,Awesome Sound! Perfect Fit! Cool Look!,"It has a powerful bass which gives a very good sound quality. Your head won't hurt even if you listen to Music on it for hours on end like I do.I use these headphones daily and have never felt like it hurt my ears or head.There's a small soft patch on the underside of the top of the headphones where the headphones touch your head. This soft cushion actually gives the headphones a feather-light feel while it rests softly on your head. So it doesn't hurt the top of your head at all.Over the ears the pads are so soft that you don't even feel like the headphones are there. And even if you wear your earrings or piercings (like I do) with the headphones on, it doesn't hurt because of those pads.And they are also convertible so you can just compress them to fit in your backpack or sack.The mic has really good sound quality too. It blocks out almost all the outside sound and catches my voice really well over call. People have told me my voice sounds very clear whenever I talk to them using these headphones.The mic also has one button on it which you can use to start/stop the Music you're playing or to pick up/end calls as well. It's very helpful!However, if you're not used to wearing headphones then you might feel like it's heavy for you or it's hurting or something like that, but it's only a matter of time before you get used to it. And if you're already a headphones user then you'll just WANT to buy these! I'm not an IT person or anything but I do require headphones for my online classes and for always listening to Music (｡���｡) so these are just PERFECT for me!Not to mention, these look SUPER cool. I bought the navy blue ones and I'm just lovin how cool they look! Like, I just can't get enough of them! And even during my online classes, I just look so fancy wearing these headphones!

Mattia RigolliMattia Rigolli,Difficile trovare di meglio con questo rapporto qualit�/prezzo,"Ho acquistato queste cuffie durante il prime day a 18,99��.All'interno della confezione si trovano le cuffie e la garanzia, a primo impatto le cuffie sembrano ben costruite, piccole e portatili (nonostante io le utilizzi solo attaccate al pc).La qualit� del suono � buona, considerando il prezzo, ed i bassi si sentono bene;Il pulsante a mio parere � poco comodo da premere (o forse devo solo prenderci l'abitudine) ma, come detto precedentemente, il mio utilizzo � esclusivamente al pc, quindi il pulsante non serve ( lo ho comunque provato attaccando le cuffie al telefono e, come � scritto sulla confezione: un click per rispondere/mettere gi�, doppio click per andare alla traccia successiva e triplo per la traccia precedente).Non ho ancora avuto occasione di provare Il microfono che, a prima vista, � abbastanza vicino al viso quindi dovrebbe sentirsi bene; comunque aggiorner� la recensione appena lo avr� provato.Passiamo ora ai punti che mi preoccupano:1) Il cavo: mi sembra abbastanza fragile;2) La copertura dei padiglioni auricolari e dell'archetto: ho come l'impressione che si usurer� prima del tempo3) Questo punto dipende dalle dimensioni della testa: ho trovato le cuffie abbastanza strette sulle orecchie, cosa che per� non mi da fastidio.Un'ultima cosa che voglio dire � che i blocchi per cambiare la lunghezza delle cuffie sono, a parer mio, molto molli, anche se una volta indossate non danno problemi.In conclusione il rapporto qualit� prezzo � buono, considerando che hanno anche il microfono, ed � difficile (almeno su Amazon) trovare cuffie imbottite con microfono pi� economiche (di marche conosciute).Aggiorner� la mia recensione appena si verificher� (si spera di no) un problema.EDIT 22/11: Ho provato pi� volte il microfono sia da solo, sia con altre persone e devo dire che la voce si sente bene, anche le persone con cui ho parlato non hanno riscontrato problemi nel sentirmi; l'audio � pulito senza eco, voce ovattata o metallica.",5,B07J2R8LNL,Colour: White,JBL,Headphones,

Il problema per� sono le cuffie stesse: stringono come una morsa in testa, all'inizio non te ne accorgi, ma dopo mezz'ora le orecchie iniziano a farti male. Assurdo, per me che ho la testa non molto grande e altre marche di cuffie le trovo larghe anche regolate al minimo. Io ad esempio ho avuto dolore all'orecchio sinistro (zona del lobo) anche il giorno dopo. Non era un dolore forte, ma debole e fastidioso che in seguito � passato. Un altro punto a sfavore secondo me sono i rivestimenti dei padiglioni, sembrano fatti di carta velina, pi� delicati dei rivestimenti di altre marche e modelli. Mi danno l'impressione che non durino molto. Il prodotto in se' sarebbe molto valido se non fosse che stringono sulla zona delle orecchie fino a diventare insopportabili.

One observation I would make is that they may not suit a person with a larger than usual head.  There's quite a bit of adjustment in the head band but the ear cups are fairly snug.  It suits me but I can imagine others finding it a bit too much if they've been used to more roomy ones.  The photo shows a comparison.As an update I have to say that I did manage to break my first pair by lying on them when falling asleep listening to music in bed.  This was after a year or more of such use and I have to accept that it was my fault.  Owing to the low cost of the headphones I wasn't overly upset and would still buy another pair.,5,B07HGTXF95,Colour: Black,JBL,Headphones,
milko,JBL garanzia di qualit� anche sulle entry level,"volevo delle cuffie per giocare con la ps4, ed anche per ascoltare la musica su spotify. Conosco da tempo la buona qualit� del marchio JBL. A livello di ascolto offre sempre dei bassi profondi ed alti molto puliti. Devo ammettere che inizialmente, visto il costo irrisorio delle cuffie (19.90 euro), ero molto scettico. Ma una volta acquistate, le consiglio sicuramente. Sono molto leggere, non � vero che l'archetto stringe molto sulla testa. La dimensione dei padiglioni � quella giusta, non danno fastidio se si indossano degli occhiali. Assolutamente da aquistare !!!",5,B07HGTXF95,Colour: Black,JBL,Headphones,

Did not expect much given the low price tag, but still disappointingThe sound quality is not upto mark at all, similar headphones from Boat at same price range do a better job. The build seems fine, decent quality plastic and the product is pretty sturdy.The biggest drawback is comfort. You can refer to the size of the earcups for which I have placed a pen next to it to show how small the earcups are. I expected it to be a On the ear model of course, but it's more like barely covering one half of the ear model, and there is a pretty intense pain on your earlobes post 30 minutes of usage. So, anyone with big ears, this is a definite no-no.The 3.5 mm jack could have been better. It does not snap right in, I mean, the click sound you here when you plug it into an Audio port.Overall, wouldn't recommend it for pretty much regular headphone users, but for sporadic users with small ears of course, do go ahead.

Ca�que Silva Coelho,O que voc s vai descobrir se for um usu�rio intensivo,"Bom, como no vi ningum aqui relatar o que eu vivi com esse produto, me sinto na obrigao de comunicar aquelas vari�veis  sobre o produto que voc s descobre com o tempo e pela repetio dos mesmos impasses e armadilhas nas trs ocasi�es em que comprei. Isso j� virou uma saga. Essa foi a terceira vez que eu comprei um JBL sem fio. Os dois primeiros ainda eram o de 500, e h� seis meses atr�s comprei esse do 510. Pois bem, venho aqui seis meses depois relatar o que s os usu�rios intensivos descobrem: que esta porcaria tem uma obsolescncia programada monstruosa. A razo pela qual eu j� comprei TR�S VEZES fones da JBL ao longo dos �ltimos trs anos  que, em todos esses casos, passados alguns meses, a bateria se suicida, ou ento o fone no liga, ou qualquer erro aleatrio comea a dinamitar a possibilidade de utiliz�-lo. Ou seja, tudo  lindo e maravilhoso, desde que voc use pouco, porque a vida �til dele  ridiculamente curta.No me levem a mal, se eu comprei trs vezes  porque todo o resto  fant�stico: o som grave  quase imperial, a bateria, quando ainda funciona,  colossal nesse 510 e muito acima da concorrncia.Entretanto,  isso que eu preciso vir falar aqui: toda essa lua de mel funciona para quem usa pouco, para quem usa de forma intensiva, voc esbarra claramente no limite da obsolescncia programada do produto: m�seros meses so o suficiente pro aparelho se suicidar, no querer ligar, a bateria pular de 50% pra 0% sem razo alguma, etc. Isso no deveria acontecer, haja vista que at celular dura muito mais do que isso sem ficar inutiliz�vel. O que adianta  JBL fazer um fone fant�stico se esse ""fant�stico"" dura 5 meses? Este �ltimo foi a gota d'�gua, foi a compra foi feita no dia 28 de janeiro de 2022 e esta desgraa j� est� ruim agora, no in�cio de agosto. At os produtos anteriores da marca tinham durado mais que isso. Enfim, essa  a situao dialtica que os usu�rios tem de ser informados: sim, ele  timo, colossal, mas essa lua de mel tem uma vida �til muito reduzida.

Achadinhos da Web,"Preo de fone de entrada, resultado de fone semi-profissional - para SA�DA de �udio","Estou usando h� duas semanas.Sou chato com fones (mas no sou m�sico ou profissional do �udio) e para mim, existem dois fatores principais: 1. a qualidade do som (principalmente dos graves) e 2. o conforto do fone em si.O resultado do JBL 710BT  cinco estrelas nesses dois critrios. O fone tem sons de tima qualidade, com zero ""estouro"" - d� para ouvir com o volume bem baixinho sem maiores distor�es, o que prefiro, e o volume alto  bastante regular (nada incr�vel, mas decente), tambm com pouca distoro. Para quem no quer perder os t�mpanos ouvindo m�sica,  uma excelente opo. O isolamento de ru�do no  perfeito, mas  excelente - em minha viso, bom o suficiente. Mas tenha em mente que no  absurdamente imersivo como modelos mais caros.O conforto  o ponto de destaque. O fone no aperta mas encaixa perfeitamente - d� para ir para a academia com ele tranquilamente - e s fica levemente desconfort�vel aps MUITAS horas de uso, mas no chega a doer a orelha como outros modelos fazem. A construo do fone  com materiais de boa qualidade e mesmo com uso intenso eles no se desgastaram em nada nesse curto per�odo. Outra caracter�stica espetacular  o alcance do Bluetooth - consigo deixar conectado no meu notebook num c�modo e ouvir sem nenhuma interrupo a partir do quarto, cerca de 15m de dist�ncia. Ali�s, aps conectado, o fone no perdeu a conexo nem ""pulou"" nenhuma vez.A bateria dura umas 40h de uso (nunca consegui passar de 80% porque recarrego sempre), o que  bastante coisa para esses fones. Usando o dia inteiro, nunca cheguei a v-lo desligar por falta de bateria, carregando todas as noites. Carrega muito r�pido e sua entrada de carregador  USB-C.O fone  bonito, ergon�mico, tima qualidade sonora - enfim, tudo que voc espera num fone JBL, s que por um preo bastante atrativo ( dif�cil achar fone assim por menos de R$400). Por isso, recomendo muito para quem precisa de algo muito prximo da qualidade profissional em relao � sa�da de �udio, mas com um preo melhor.O ponto negativo  o microfone.  bem baixo, e sua qualidade no  melhor que um in-built de notebook de performance, por exemplo. Tem uma espcie de cancelamento de ru�dos externos que at funciona bem, mas ao trabalhar o �udio, percebe-se aquele chiado de microfone mdio. Ento, para gravao de v�deos, por exemplo, acredito que o modelo no  ideal e  melhor ter um microfone ""dedicado"".Gostei do produto, entrega Amazon nota 10.",5,B096G2RN6D,Colour: Black | Style Name: Tune (Over-Ear BT) | Pattern Name: Headphone,JBL,Headphones,

Sayooj Chathoth,"Great headphone, but lacking app support","I have been using the headphones (TUNE 760) for more than a month, here is my reviewAt first (2 days of purchasing) I was very disappointed because I felt that the sound quality was very lacking, the base and loudness disappointed me, but after a week, it started to sound very very good, I think it needed a burn period, because this headphone is now sounding very very good for me.Build Quality - the build quality is good, no major issues, the pad is soft.Comfort - the headphone is comfortable, but one issue is that the clamping force is a bit tight, maybe because I have a big head. Another thing is, even though this is an over read headphone it is not that big, so some part of my ear gets a bit uncomfortable after long use, but if u adjust and find the correct comfortable position, you cab wear it for a long time, I watched a 3 hr movie without any issuesBattery - omg, one of the best part of this headphone, claims 50 hr without noise cancellation, I think it lives upto the mark. You don't have to worry about batterySound quality - I'm not an audiophile, let me clear it up. The sound quality I felt was really good and I was very impressed, after the burn in period, so if you are buying this give it at least 1 week before judging it, trust me it really really gets better. The base was not that high, but not lacking also, was upto the mark.Noise cancellation - it wasn't really that great, could slightly reduce the fan noise that's it, I wouldn't say it is useless, but not that bad either, could reduce the noise of tv from next room when I listened to music, so it did came in handy also with noise cancellation the sound quality I felt improved a bit.Conclusion - as I said, I was really disappointed at first with the purchase, thought I wasted the money(6.5k) but now I'm really really enjoyed it, watching movies was the best experience with dolby music profile in my phone. I'd say it is really worth the money if ur looking for a headphone around 7k",4,B096FZQ5WC,Colour: Blue | Style Name: Tune (Over-Ear NC) | Pattern Name: Headphone,JBL,Headphones,

Derrick Samuel,"Good sound quality, mediocre ANC","These headphones are a little disorienting, and I can explain. I was a bit skeptical on what the ANC would be like on budget headphones. And I was right.The first thing I noticed when I tried these on was the kind of seal around the ears. It creates this vacuum-like effect where it feels like all the air in and around your ears have been sucked out, which could be good for the noise cancelling, but definitely feels strange. And then there is the active noise cancelling itself, which when you turn on, it kind of shuts out the world around you, but only a little bit. It doesn't cancel white noise, it just makes it quieter. I was still able to hear the fan in my room, and my fan is not noisy in the first place. The ANC was a disappointment and made me feel uncomfortable after a while.The sound quality on the other hand, is good. I have used some JBL headphones like the JBL Quantum 600, and these have a sound that is similar to those headphones. It's a typical JBL sound, where there is slightly more emphasis to the bass and treble, but the mids are not completely crushed. So it sounds like the entire range has been amplified. It's a good sound for people who like the presence of good bass, but don't want too much bass.Battery life has been good so far. Do note that these don't come with a carrying case, but the headphones can be folded. They charge via USB-C, they have an audio jack and come with a cable.Overall, these sound good. I just wish the ANC was better.",3,B096G115MV,Colour: White | Style Name: Tune (Over-Ear NC) | Pattern Name: Headphone,JBL,Headphones,

Raj AbhishekRaj Abhishek,Not worth 6k. This headphones doesn't justify its price.,"If you are throwing just in the name of JBL then please atleast don't go for this. Increr your budget and buy premium one. Because the type of experience this particular headt is just an average. I think 2-3k priced headphones can also give this kind of experience. The sound quality is good. But there is some kind of weirdnes i notice. When you listen to music without ANC then there will no bass at all. When you hear it a ANC you will find some base. But when you maximize the volume then bass will go away. And in my case at full or 90% sound level with my equilizer onn, the sounds tears apart like some cheap roadside headphones. Battery life is so far is v good. With aux cable also same kind experience you get. This headphones is not loud. Because it can't handle loud sound. The sound become dull and start tearing. Overall this could good headphone if would have paid 2-2.5k not 5.6k. #Iam returning this item.",3,B096FYLJ6M,Colour: Black | Style Name: Tune (Over-Ear NC) | Pattern Name: Headphone,JBL,Headphones,

Rodrigo,Desconfort�vel,"Apesar de uma tima qualidade no som, o fone de ouvido encosta na cartilagem da orelha. Quando tirei os headphones notei uma irritao na orelha esquerda. Tentei de toda forma ajustar os headphones para ter conforto, mas sem sucesso. Como passou do per�odo de devoluo, fiquei no preju�zo. Apesar do desconforto, o fone de ouvido tem boa praticidade por ser dobr�vel, cabendo na mochila ou em um case apropriado para o tamanho dele. Inclusive  decepcionante no ser vendido nenhum case para guardar o fone de ouvido. Carrega rapidamente atravs do computador, no demorou nem 1h. E a bateria dura bastante, com intervalo de 2 dias e 4 horas de uso ainda no descarregou.

Janaina,Complica�es se voc tiver um cr�nio mais avantajado.,"Uso o fone para o b�sico, escutar m�sica sem muitos problemas como ru�do e m� qualidade de �udio. Para ser franca, os graves realmente deixam um pouco a desejar, conforme o falado em outras avalia�es, mas eu no dei muita ateno apenas por no entender dos termos tcnicos de �udio e equipamentos de �udio, enfim...Fone bom, cumpre conforme o proposto pela marca, com algumas ressalvas por ele no ser um fone top de linha e etc. Se voc quer qualidade total, por esse valor no tem nem como cobrar da JBL, nem da linha a qual o produto faz parte. No jogo nem trabalho com �udio, m�sica etc, ento ele serviu como uma luva.Pontos negativos que se sobressa�ram na minha experincia:- se voc tem uma cabea grande (rindo muito disso, mas  a realidade), ele vai te dar uma dor no uso a longo prazo. Acho que por ele isolar bem o som, existe uma fora maior na estrutura que deixa o fone fixo, mas se voc tem uma cabea grande, vai apertar, vai doer, isso em menos de uma hora de uso. Sempre tenho que ficar tirando ele para aliviar a presso.- o volume  muito bom, o m�ximo  bastante potente mas perde a qualidade. No consigo escutar nada no m�ximo pois me causa dor de cabea e a qualidade do som  bastante reduzida, ainda mais os graves, fazendo parecer um fone barato com �udio estourado.- o fone isola bastante os ru�dos externos, ento, no recomendo que seja usado na rua, j� que se algo acontecer voc possivelmente no estar� escutando e poder� se acidentar.Esses so os pontos que me fazem desgostar um pouco dele, mas foi uma boa compra, com as suas ressalvas j� citadas.Recomendo para quem quer um fone b�sico, sem esperar muito e para uso em casa.",4,B096G2RN6D,Colour: Black | Style Name: Tune (Over-Ear BT) | Pattern Name: Headphone,JBL,Headphones,

Da segunda em diante quase sempre preciso desparear (apagar o headset do histrico de pareamento) e parear novamente.Cancelamento de ru�do no ""abafa"" totalmente o som externo no ambiente mas...  questo de saber que  uma headset de entrada com cancelamento de ru�do e mesmo assim consegue diminuir muito o barulho do ambiente mesmo sem nenhum som sendo reproduzido no headset (enquanto ouvindo m�sica com cancelamento a� sim praticamente no ouve nada do ambiente).Veredito: considerando que um fone com 100% de cancelamento de ru�do custa bem mais de 1000 reais, foi uma boa compra esse fone por 399 com cancelamento de ru�do (NC) e boa autonomia de bateria (em torno de 30 e poucas horas de autonomia com NC ativado).A cor branca  mais barata mas no recomendo comprar porque ouvi alguns relatos de pessoas com headset branco que se arrependeram por causa da cor que suja muito f�cil.",5,B08QVJRQXD,Colour: Black | Style Name: Tune (On-Ear NC) | Pattern Name: Headphone,JBL,Headphones,

Sarbik A.Sarbik A.,WORST BASS EVER,"DONT BUY THESEIF YOU ARE AN AUDIOPHILE. Yes you read that right. I bought these to see how the music experience would be like and to my surprise its the worst. THERE IS NO BASS IN THESE. NOT AT ALL. If i have to rate the bass out of 10 i would rate it 3. 3 too because at least i get to know that there is bass in the song. Cant believe this headphones cost almost 5K rupees. Also it has NO IP rating. So prone to water damage is high. Along with it, i used Zebronics Headphones too which was less than 1K rupees and the music experience was waaaaaay better than these JBL ones. I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THESE HEADPHONES AND JBL brand.VOLUME IS VERY LOW...even at 100% you wont feel any bass, however other things like treble vocals are not disturbed even at 100% volume but it  feels dry with no bass....ironically the name is PURE BASS HEADPHONE.......i dont know how....i will rate this headphones as follows-1. Durable - 6/102. Music Experience - 4/103. Mic quality - 8/104. ENC/ANC - 6/105. Comfort - 8/106. Looks - 8/107.

Can connect to 2 devices at a time.Even though 710bt does not have ANC , I like them, there isn't much you can hear after you play a song,The Bass is cool , not too high not too low , there's a lot of clarity in the music , plus with dolby atmos in the phone ,  I'm having a pretty great experience.Its not tight on the head to me for like atleast maybe 4-5 hrs , but if you wear it longgg enough , yea you'll want to adjust it  or remove it completely, but I feel that's pretty much with every headphone right?Just for reference I watched the entire first season of stranger things without removing them once or getting bothered.Umm it bothers a little when you wear it down on the neck cause it is foldable , but i think i figured out something, you can wear the right side on the left one and fold them inside out,Hope all of this helps.",5,B096G2RN6D,Colour: Black | Style Name: Tune (Over-Ear BT) | Pattern Name: Headphone,JBL,Headphones,

Sumesh Murali,Excellent Headset for the price,"Using this product for 2 weeks. It's a 4.5 star product but not 5 star due to following reasons. I listen to music a lot, watch movies and also plays a lot of games. My experience is given below.Cons.1. Ear comfort ( 4.5 stars )- Although the product is extremely comfortable I have large ears so a little pain is there if I use it for prolonged periods (2 hour +). People with small to medium ear size may not have any problem with this. I will have to remove for a few minutes and then I can continue. The ear cushions are really soft and the comfort is so far the best.2. Adding to the above point - if you are living in a relatively hot area, ears might sweat and may become uncomfortable. My place is 30+ degree Celsius always. In cooler climate the issue is not existing.3. Audio quality is excellent but really minimal buzzing is there for deep bass. This will not be noticeable at all if you are playing music or gaming. For music and audio editing this may be an issue. Not sure if this is only there for my product. I am satisfied with the product so not returning it.4. No next or prev buttons.Pros.1. Extremely long battery life and quick charging. I have been using the product for 4 days without recharging and is a huge plus. Not tested how many hours I get with ANC on but is pretty long. I use the headsets for 5-6 hours daily and is really good. Charging is pretty quick too.2. ANC is really good. While I was traveling it was able to filter most of the traffic noice except really loud noises. People chatting and other noice is not at all audible so Mom might get angry ;)3. Latency is really low. I was able to play pubg mobile with this and latency was almost undetected but it is there.4. Audio quality is superb, bass is pretty good and is the best so far5. Premium build quality. Weight is little high than the cheap plastic and fibre headsets. This one has metal frame.6. Good range.7. Nice fit. Not too tight not too loose.",4,B096FYLJ6M,Colour: Black | Style Name: Tune (Over-Ear NC) | Pattern Name: Headphone,JBL,Headphones,

Peter Schneider,"Wer Bedienungsanleitung braucht, ist schlecht beraten","Vom Klang her ist der Hrer ein wirklicher Allesknner. Er verstrkt anscheinend die ganz tiefen Frequenzen etwas.

Da aber in der Sprache ganz tiefe Frequenzen nicht vorkommen, ist auch Sprache sehr gut verstndlich und drhnt nicht. Der Hrer sitzt etwas fest und ist nicht ganz leicht, denn schlielich hat er ja einen ziemlich grossen Akku, der recht lange durchhlt.Die elektronische Geruschunterdrckung funktioniert rech gut. Besonders werden tiefe Strgerusche beseitigt, was z. B. in S-Bahnen sehr gut wirkt.

Michael,Awesome Headphones for not just bass lovers,"I started with Skullcandy ear buds, love them. Moved to Skullcandy Hesh 2, really like them. I listened to a friends Beats Studio and realized that my Hesh 2's are really good but not great. I went to a big box store and spent a good twenty to thirty minutes testing Beats Studio wireless, Sony XB950BT wireless and Skullcandy Crusher wireless. I was digging all of them and decided to buy all three, test them out on my own music and make my decision. There is no doubt that the Beats and Sony are more comfortable than the Skullcandy Crusher wireless. Even the Hesh 2's are more comfortable than the Crushers. That said, none of them in my opinion match the Skullcandy Crusher wireless when it comes to sound quality (highs, mids and lows). The Skullcandy wireless fit very snug and require you to find the sweet spot that is not so tight on you. Surprisingly my second choice would have been the Sony's which are super comfortable but the all or nothing bass boost mostly stayed in the off position. The Crusher bass slider allows you to add just what you want or go ballistic and rattle your head. I would give the Skullcandy Crusher wireless 4 1/2 stars subtracting only for comfort. This haptic bass technology should be used to create a competitor for my Bose Soundlink wireless speaker. A definite recommendation to purchase the Skullcandy Crusher wireless headphones.",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Mi,The rave reviews are surprising.,"I'd like to begin by explaining that I am a bit of an audiophile. I'm not completely sure why I chose to purchase skull candy brand headphones, but I think it has something to do with an $8 pair of earbuds I purchased from them years ago that showed that response below 40 hz in cheap earbuds was infact possible.  Anyways, I recently decided to purchase bluetooth headphones for working out, and the haptic bass feature and the crazy battery life of these peaked my interest. Plus, I cant be too picky with sound during workouts. (I guess basic expectations with audio quality were too high for these headphones. Lets just say these things are outdone by the apple earpods that came with my late iphone 5.)I guess ill start with the bad:1. THE HAPTIC BASS IS TERRIBLE! I'm not even being picky here. Firstly, the haptic bass only effects the midbass region of sound, not even the actual bass. Basslines of modern pop music utilize the haptic bass, but TRUELY LOW NOTES DO NOT UTILIZE THE HAPTIC BASS!!! This produces an incredibly weird sound signature with a massive shelf that jumps +30db at least in the midbass region. It should be called haptic midbase.2. The haptic bass is muddy and undefined. Seriously, I think it only produces 5 different frequencies tops.3. THE REASON THESE HEADPHONES WERE UNLISTENABLE FOR ME: So some engineer thought that it would be cool to add a power saving feature that deactivates that haptic bass when the music does not require it. This would be a totally legitimate feature if the haptic bass reactivated instantaneously as it was required. Instead, the haptic bass doesn't activate until 3-5 seconds after a ""bass drop""(seriously!). This produces a drastic change in the sound signature anytime the haptic bass kicks in. So say a song has 4 choruses that are bass-heavy and the verses have practically zero bass. When the bass drops, the haptic bass will kick in 3 seconds after the chorus starts and kick off 3 seconds after the chorus ends.  Not only does this mean that you have weird offset sound response changes, it means that the frequency response drastically changes 8 times throughout the course of a song!!! In conclusion, music sounds very different through these headphones, but in an awful way.4. The bluetooth connectivity leaves something to be desired. While you are moving, the audio seems to cut out a lot.5. The membranes utilized by the haptic bass produce thumps with every step you take during a jog. Probably explains why the haptic bass is so loose.The good:1. The battery life seems to be just as good as they advertise. Better than any bluetooth headphones i've ever tried.",1,B01DWH7AIM,Colour: Gray/Tan,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
DanyelDanyel,Great Sounding and Function: Just Bad Material I Used I Guess-Severely Disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, these are fantastic sounding headphones, but the quality could have been better built. I've had these for three months and they already started cracking and yes, I've used a hard headphone case so protect them, but where the seams are on the headphones is directly where the cracks started to happen. I'm a little disappointed because the price I paid and I've never had a problem with skullcandy headphones before. But I think because the quality on the adjustable part is soft, it cracks easily. I can't wear them in public anymore because it's physically ugly to look at and I don't know when the other side is going to decide to just crack all the way off. In honesty, I feel as though I've wasted my money which again, is hard to say because I love SkullCandy products and I've never had a problem with their headphones until now. I'm giving it two stars just because with the amount I paid, they shouldn't be cracking in three months. And I'm a small girl, not heavy-handed. I own like four other headphones because I really love headphones lol, but this was a true disappointment, especially since they sound so great and the function is really good and supportive. Plus, a month after I had them, the dye from my blue coat started to transfer on them and I wasn't mad at skullcandy because I'm like, well, it's my coat, probably has heavy dye or something, but I started to wear my other headphones when these started cracking and none of them had the same problem which means it's the material they used as the soft outer shell that picks up dye easily. I'll still be buying from SkullCandy just not these headphones or types of headphones again I think. I don't want the same thing to happen twice.",2,B01DWH7AIM,Colour: Gray/Tan,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
AY reviews,Don't hurry! Try over a store first.,"Okay. I was very excited when I purchased this. Read reviews and heard it's one of the best high bass headphones. N finally I purchased it.1. Sound quality - quality is same as any good headphones which may be lower in rate.2. Battery life - it's been what 20 days since I purchased it. N must be listening to it around 2 hrs average. I never charged it. Still using the backup it came up with. It's still showing half of juice left. INSANE.3. Bass - I was very excited about this. But believe me its just a gimmick. You'll start getting uncomfortable after sometime. It's more of vibration than so called bass. It come up with haptic engine used by Apple as well. So it vibrates to give bass effect. Now I don't increase the bass at all. It's better that ways.VERDICT - it's expensive, buy something around 5k and it'll serve the purpose. Battery is no doubt insane that the only thing keeping me from regretting the purchase. And bass is just a gimmick which can be avoided. So choose wisely!",3,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Amazon CustomerAmazon Customer,Crusher in reality  ( hopes and dream crusher ),"Crusher is a very appropriate name provided to the product as it crushes your dream of owning a costly pair of headphones, expecting it to be high quality product. Product no doubt has a great sound, but what is the use if the plastic housing the entire circuit and machinery is made from poor quality plastic.Guess what?? I had contacted the replacement department of the Indian skull candy dealer(brand eyes) and they further CRUSHED my hopes of ever using these headphones. Even though they are in warranty period, they refuse to replace it due to external damage due to the following reasons1)Warranty shall be void if the product has been opened, attended at any unauthorized service center or third party.2)Faults of which the purchaser was already aware of at the time of purchase.3)Damage by any violent head-banging session (wearing the headphone improper way).4)Faults due to accident, lightening, misuse and ingress of water/moisture.5)Faults due to wear and tear and force majeure.6)Faults due to exposure to caustic substances, fire, improper ventilation, dropping, mishandling or excessive shock or any external cause beyond Skullcandy’s control and/or any damage caused due to tampering of the product by an unauthorized agent.7)Warranty shall not cover any damages resulting from un-authorized adaptations, improper or reckless use, damage on account of high ampere charging, defined as charging ampere > 1.1A or unattended long duration of charge exceeding 30 mins.My damage didn't fall in any of the policies stated above but still the customer care would respond with automated replies and wouldn't tend to issues of replacing a small part. I am just asking to replace the hinge , but they wouldn't listen at all .If you purchase these and when you want to use them, you would want to take them and unfold them , but listen if you unfold them slowly and carefully and what if the hinge breaks?!! it is better to use them as speakers! but be careful don't touch them! the headphone might still break. It should be renamed as Skullcandy Delicate® Series or Dream® Crusher",1,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
ZomniacZomniac,Crap headphones from a sell-out company...,"I used to think that Skullcandy was the best on the market.  Premium sound, and excellent material quality.  Well, it actually looks like they have taken the path that so many companies do... crappy materials and poor manufacturing.To save a few bucks and to make a bigger profit margin, Skullcandy uses a very cheap plastic that does not stand up to the rigors of taking on and off your headset.They know it, too.  They do testing.  Not to assure the consumers of quality and workmanship, but to figure out how long they'll last so they can set their expectations of replacements and warranty limit to further escape the shoddy quality.I had these for nearly 3 months and in the normal course of putting on the headphones, the left earphone broke away from the headband in an irreparable way.  I had already noticed, in the last few days or so, an ever widening crack in the right earphone happening, and I thought, when the earphone came off in my hand, that I had put them on backwards, and it was that side that had broken off.  I was wrong.  It was the plastic hinge that broke.When will manufacturers and engineers ever learn, plastic hinges are NOT durable and will always eventually, inevitably fail.  Planned obsolescence I guess... keep them buying...Dammit, I'm mad!  I should be offered a full refund for a manufacturing defect, because they cannot seriously think that these parts are solid.",1,B01DWH7AIM,Colour: Gray/Tan,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Matthew,My favorite headphones of all time easily. Best Bass and best looking.,"These were my first serious headphone purchase ever. Before these headphones, I bought the $20 Bluetooth earbuds that hurt my ears or $5 earbuds from the target. It has been a year since I bought these and I can say firmly that these are the best headphones that I have ever tried. I was considering the Bose QuietComfort 35 Bose QuietComfort 35 (Series II) Wireless Headphones, Noise Cancelling - Black or the Senhieser PXC 550 Sennheiser PXC 550 Wireless - NoiseGard Adaptive Noise Cancelling, Bluetooth Headphone with Touch Sensitive Control and 30-Hour Battery Life I tested both of these headphones in stores and watched reviews and I thought that they were the way to go until I found out about these. I am a bass head for sure. I listen to a lot of rock and rap so bass is very important to me and I love the adjustable bass controller on the back. You can literally feel the bass which is possibly my favorite thing about these headphones. These were my one and only pair of headphones for my first year of college. I wore them on my 2 hour commute to school and the 2 hour commute back not to mention the hours in the library. I ABUSED these headphones and they are still kicking with full force. Their sound is very bass heavy so you do lose some quality at the higher end but you won't really notice it unless you are listening to a lot of that kind of music. Another thing I love is that they also go above the volume set from your device using the controls on the headpiece. I can play my music at full volume and not feel any pain at all which is nice and I do like that they are loud. The wireless connection is very impressive. I can walk anywhere in my house with very little connection dropping. Additionally, the headphones are very heavy and sturdy and I love that about them. I really felt the quality of these headphones. The ear cups are very comfortable and the head strap is this very soft silicon which really balances out the weight. I have literally worn these headphones for 12 hours straight during finals and I did not feel any discomfort during that whole time. The are made of a hard plastic and comes in a matte black or white (I opted for the black). They are very stylish and don't stick out like other bass heavy headphones like the Sony XB. The branding is almost invisible and sit pretty tight on the head so they won't make you look weird.I have 2 problems with these headphones. First, they don't have noise canceling which isn't really a problem since they are pretty loud but I would like that option. Also a related issue is that there is a good amount of sound bleed. The people sitting next to you can hear what you're listening to which is a non-issue but if you care about you're privacy it is something to keep in mind.3 year update:I've been using these headphones as my daily driver for 3 years. Multiple vacations, commuting 2 hours to school every day, summer internship and so much more and it is still fighting strong. I haven't seen any diminished sound. All that I've seen so far is the hinge for the earpiece started to fall apart, unfortunately. It hasn't affected the usability much but it is annoying as it feels like it will fall apart soon. That being said, I don't trust another pair of headphones to produce the sound and feel that I got from these headphones. My next pair of headphones will most likely be another pair of crushers wireless.",4,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
VonsidVonsid,Feel the bass,"Edit apr�s 6 mois : Un des arceaux en plastique qui tient l'couteur et lui permet de coulisser a commenc � se fendre, malgr une utilisation prcautionneuse. Il y a donc peut-�tre une fragilit � ce niveau-l�. Je tiens nanmoins � souligner le comportement exemplaire de Skullcandy, qui a accept ma demande de garantie et m'a renvoy un produit neuf. Produit et marque recommands.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit + 1 mois : Vu que plusieurs personnes ont apprci cette critique et que �a fait plaisir, je reviens l'tayer un peu apr�s un mois d'utilisation. C'est toujours 4 toiles et j'en suis toujours satisfait. Nanmoins, quelques petites prcisions ou choses que j'ai remarques :-  Le changement de chanson, qui se fait par une pression sur le bouton + pour avancer et - pour reculer, demande trop de temps. Il faut tenir le doigt appuy 4 ou 5 secondes et quand vous faites une activit physique, c'est trop long. 2/3 secondes auraient t nettement mieux.- L'isolation phonique n'est pas le point fort de ce casque, dans les deux sens. Si vous �tes dans un endroit bruyant ou normalement bruyant (rue, transports en commun, salle de sport), vous ne drangerez personne. Mais si vous souhaitez l'utiliser dans un endroit silencieux (biblioth�que par exemple), ce n'est pas le casque qu'il vous faut. A l'inverse, on est bien immerg dans sa musique � volume normal mais on n'est pas totalement coup du monde extrieur, on discerne encore certains bruits. Personnellement �a ne me drange pas, mais si vous cherchez une isolation totale, �a ne conviendra pas.- Le matriau des couteurs semble rsistant � la transpiration. ne pas oublier de les essuyer apr�s une activit physique nanmoins.- Ils tiennent bien, voire tr�s bien sur la t�te. En faisant du vlo, rameur, muscu, pas de souci, �a serre comme il faut. Par contre j'aurais aim que le casque puisse s'tirer un peu plus, l� c'est un peu trop court quand on ne l'utilise pas et qu'on veut le garder autour du cou par exemple.- la batterie tient ses promesses de 40 heures, et ne devoir la recharger qu'une fois par semaine, �a change absolument tout.- Il est dommage qu'il n'y ai pas un indicateur de niveau de charge permanent, nanmoins une lumi�re verte s'allume et on a un message audio quand le charge ncessite d'�tre recharg.- Skullcandy ne commercialise pas de mousses d'couteurs de remplacement. C'est un vrai probl�me � mon sens. Si les miennes se dgradent avec mon usage quotidien et que je ne peux pas les changer, malgr toutes les qualits du casque, je me tournerais vers une autre marque au moment de le remplacer.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Critique originaleJ'ai toujours eu tendance a considrer Skullcandy comme une marque faisant des produits fashion au look agressif pour ados mais avec un son dgueulasse. Ce Skullcrusher Wireless me fait reconsidrer cette position.Pour commencer, niveau esthtique, il est tr�s sobre et �a me pla�t. Finitions noires et acier que l'on dcouvre sur l'arceau permettant d'ajuster les couteurs. Globalement �a reste du plastique mais on a pas l'impression d'avoir un jouet entre les mains. Point tr�s important, le confort, il est bon ici. Je peux le porter longtemps sans ressentir de g�ne ou de chaleur au niveau des oreilles. Il serre un peu plus que la moyenne, mais �a n'est pas douloureux et du coup il reste bien en place.Au niveau du son, il est tr�s correct pour moi, au niveau du prix demand voire m�me meilleur. Il sonne clair, contrairement � ce qu'on aurait pu craindre. Les puristes du son aiment bien cracher sur ce casque. On vous dira que les basses ""ne sont pas naturelles"", que certaines frquences de basses sont mal prises en compte. Il y a probablement du vrai l�-dedans, mais tout ce que je peux dire, c'est que pour l'utilisateur lambda ne recherchant pas la perfection phonique ou des dtails que seule une oreille exerce sera en mesure de dtecter, il donne satisfaction. J'ai quand m�me rencontr un souci que je prf�re signaler : lorsque je me suis loign de mon PC et donc de la cl Bluetooth, � une distance d'environ 2.75 m, le son prsentait des crpitements. Quand je dois l'utiliser loin de sa source je passe donc en mode filaire pour viter ces parasites.Le rglage des basses directement sur le casque est un vrai plus, pas besoin d' utiliser un logiciel externe pour ajuster la basse sur son tlphone ou de se lever de son lit  quand on coute de la musique ou regarde un film tranquillement � partir d'un PC.  Surtout que chaque chanson peut demander un rglage de basse diffrent et �a peut vite devenir contraignant, l� hop, on ajuste rapidement � partir du bouton coulissant. Au maximum, le niveau de basses produites est draisonnable, mais � 40/50 % vous allez clairement ressentir votre musique sans tuer la qualit sonore, la vibration tant produite par un subwoofer ddi et non par l'enceinte qui dlivre le son. Tr�s bien aussi pour les films d'action. Vu que la l'intensit de la vibration n'est pas totalement lie � la puissance du son, on peut atteindre un niveau de vibration correct sans pour autant devoir monter le volume � s'en tuer les oreilles. L'autonomie est tr�s bonne, annonce autour de 40 heures.En conclusion, si vous voulez un casque bluetooth avec un bon son et qui vous permette de vivre vos contenus plus intensment, celui-ci fera parfaitement l'affaire.N'hsitez pas a poser des questions si vous en avez, et � cliquer sur oui si cette critique vous a paru utile, �a rcompense le temps pass � sa rdaction ;)",4,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Niko Rsemann,Wer h�tte das Ggedacht,"Ich habe mir vor kurzem den B&O Beoplay H7 zugelegt und fand diesen schon recht teuer f�r ein Kopfhhrer, doch w�re ich bereit f�r guten Sound den auch zu zahlen. Er klingt toll doch so wirklich vom Hocker gerissen hat er mich nicht.Dann hab ich mir f�r sage und schreibe 400€ den Bowers & Wilkins P7 bestellt und war wirklich begeistert von dem Sound und der Qualit�t der Kopfhhrer. Egal in welchem Genre Musik gehrt wird ist er Spitze.Ich wollte ihn auch schon behalten, aber dann waren 400€ f�r ein Kopfhhrer nicht mit meinem Gewissen vereinbar und ich bestellte mir nochmal zwei Modelle.Den Bose Soundlink Around Ear II und durch einen Zufall den hier umworbenen Skullcandy Crusher Wireless. Ich h�tte mir von Skullcandy nicht wirklich viel erhofft, da ich dachte f�r den Preis kann es nichts sein und die Bass Funktion eh nur ein Witz ist. Doch ich habe mich get�uscht.Doch zuerst den Bose per Bluetooth verbunden und dann die ganz groe Ern�chterung, er sieht nicht nur sehr billig aus f�r 200€ sondern hrt sich noch billiger an. Das h�tte ich von Bose nicht erwartet und der kopfhhrer geht umgehend zur�ck.Ich habe dann den Skullcandy innerlich schon zur Post gebracht als ich das Paket aufmachte, doch dann kam mir ein ziemlich klarer und direkter Sound in die Ohren. Ich wollte es echt nicht wahrhaben das der billigste Kopfhhrer den zweitbesten Klang neben den B&W hat.Mit dem Bass Regler kann man super jedes Musikfeste in Szene setzten, bei elektronischer Musik ist er bei 25% da es sonst echt zu viel wird.Fazit:Teuer ist nicht immer besser.Wenn es rein um die Soundqualit�t geht und um die Verarbeitung, dann w�rde ich den Bowers & Wilkins behalten, doch 400€ sind einfach soooo viel Geld im Gegensatz zu den 130€ f�r den Crusher.Ich werde den kopfhhrer behalten obwohl er nicht ganz an den Sound rankommt und die Verarbeitung nicht ansatzweise dem B&W entspricht.Ich hoffe ich konnte Ihnen mit meinen Eindr�cken etwas helfen.",4,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Meric Ilkan,Super Klang. Aber kein Komfort,"Das Positive:Zun�chst einmal war ich bereits auf der IFA 2017 mehr als beeindruckt von den Kopfhrern und dem Mega-Bass-Sound.Nach fast weiteren 8 Monaten entschloss ich mich dann die Kopfhrer hier bei Amazon zu kaufen. Sind super verarbeitet und sehen echt chic aus (Weiss/Braun). Klanglich sicherlich besser als jede Beats Kopfhrer, die nicht ann�hernd diese Klangqualit�t bieten (zu diesem vergelichsweise Minipreis). Gute Hhen, ausgewogene Mitten und (wer es mag) mrderische und druckvolle B�sse (regulierbar). Die Kopfhrer sind auch sehr gut verarbeitet, gut gepolstert und trotz hoher Lautst�rke dringt nichts nach Aussen. Sind f�r den Preis absolut hochwertig.(Leider) Das Negative:Wollte eigentlich w�hrend der permanenten Arbeit (8h/Tag) in der Agentur mich anst�ndig beschallen lassen. Aber mehr als 30 Min am St�ck geht gar nicht...... Der Anpressdruck des Kopfhrers ist leider unertr�glich. Ich spreche hier nicht vom Bassdruck oder Klang/Sound. Die Kopfhrer dr�cken sowas auf die inneren Ohrmuscheln, dass nach ca 30 Min Hrvergn�gen der Schmerz so stark wird, dass ich die Kopfhrer absetzen muss. Und das trotz der guten Polsterung!. Ich bin weder sensible noch empfindlich. Habe �ber 25 Jahre als professioneller DJay in den Clubs gearbeitet. Kopfhrer (auch �ber die 300 EUR Marke) gehrten immer zu meiner Grundausstattung. Dass diese Kopfhrer solche Schmerzen verursachen h�tte ich echt nicht gedacht.  �brigens ich bin kein Brillentr�ger! Nicht dass es heit der B�gel meiner Brille verursacht den Schmerz.

El bajo al final no tiene definicin solo tiene una gran resonancia en una frecuencia, no recuerdo si 80 o 90 hz, muy lejos de ser plano o definido.Son divertidos para un rato o para mezclar ayudan mucho a monitorear el kick en un club donde hay mucho ruido externo a�n as� se siente que se van a romper con un mal uso o en un descuido por lo cual tampoco los utilizo para mezclar seguido jajaja.Rese�a original:Soy ingeniero en audio, estaba buscando unos audifonos para salir de viaje, estaba entre unos AKG, AUDIO TECHNICA m50x y estos, Ya tengo unos AKG q701 que cuestan el doble que estos y lo que odio es que al ser abiertos no tienen nada de bajos.He escuchado los audio technica porque en la mayor�a de los estudios a los que he ido los tienen y estaba seguro de comprarme esos, pero lo pens muy bien y quise comprar unos audifonos mas divertidos, hace 10 a�os no compraba unos skullcandy y los deje de comprar por su calidad de fabricacin, pero bueno hasta ahorita los he tenido 15 d�as y no he tenido problemas y se ven solidos, el tiempo dir cuanto duran(el fader de los bajos se siente muy cheap, loose y plastico).Pero regresando al sonido que tienen estos audifonos son MUUUUY cargados en graves, se escucha como si estuvieras en un coche con subwoofer cuando les subes el fader del bajo al maximo, tanto que los medios se empiezan a atenuar o ""ensuciar"" y a la larga la verdad es que cansa escucharlos con los bajos al maximo.Pero la verdad es que escuchando m�sica que no tiene tanto low end logras escuchar frecuencias graves que con ningunos otros audifonos he escuchado, ni siquiera con in ears, creo que ningun otro audifono tiene este sistema de vibracin (solo unos hi-end de kickstarter) y fue otro de los puntos por lo cual me convencieron.Al principio no me acostumbraba a su sonido, de hecho pens en regresarlos porque no me convenc�an y aparte si les pegas puedes escuchar el sensor haptico resonando o cuando tienes los graves al maximo y hay notas cortas de un bajo suele quedarse vibrando creando una resonancia que te da una referencia erronea de la duracion de las notas graves.Ahora, los he utilizado para producir, reggaeton, trap, merengue, etc. y me han servido para mejorar mi monitoreo de frecuencias graves, ya que comparando con otras canciones el bajo y luego poniendo mis producciones logro nivelar bien el contenido de los graves; siempre tengo problemas con eso, tengo unos rokit 8 y un cuarto que no tiene acondicionamiento acustico y hay muchas frecuencias estacionarias por lo cual mi referencia de los graves se distorsiona mucho en nivel y  hasta en afinacion. pero con estos aud�fonos  puedo saber cuando son ""muchos graves"" y cuando le faltan ""mas graves"".Tambin me gust que por ms que los intento subir de nivel no distorsionan como es en el caso de mis AKG que de por si suenan muy ""queditos"" y si les subes mucho empiezan a clippear.El plus es que aparte de tener cable miniplug con microfono, tienen bluetooth y una bater�a de MUUUUUUCHA capacidad, por lo menos me fui de viaje una semana, los cargue al maximo y nunca los tuve que cargar en todo el viaje,  los utilize a lo mucho 15 horas pero he tenido otros audifonos bluetooth que tengo que estar conectndolos todo el tiempo.>No son considerados audifonos de estudio y no los recomendar�a si los quieres exclusivamente para producir o para mezclar, solo digo que son buena referencia para bajos y si tienes otra buena referencia para medios y agudos puedes trabajar muy bien con estos para monitorear tus frecuencias graves. No considero que tienen un bajeo preciso solo que son buenos para comparar tus frecuencias graves con otras canciones.Ah tambien el cable miniplug que trae se ve muuyyy delgado y delicado. trae su cable para cargar que est decente y un softcase que tiene un colchoncito muy suavecito por dentro y unas redes para guardar un par de cables.Tengo una cabezota y estos audifonos me apretaban al principio, ahora se han aflojado pero me siguen apretando un poco,  supongo que esta bien que no se hayan puesto aguados, no son tan comodos como mis AKG pero los akg cuestan el doble y los audio technica se me hacen mas incomodos de las almohadillas.Lo unico que me sigue dando miedo es la calidad de construccin, los trato con pinzas para que no se rompan, he escuchado varias historias de terror pero tambin investigue y si se te rompen hay dise�os de piezas en 3d para que puedas imprimir y darles una nueva vida a los audifonos entonces ""i was sold"".Espero les haya servido esta review.",3,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
JuggernautJuggernaut,Thunderstruck,"For you bass monkeys out there look no further!Your ears are about to be amazed with insane bass.I own both Beats Powerbeats and Beats by Dre Studio but have been left wanting more. I recently started back up at the gym and the Powerheats lack bass and noise isolation. The Studio's have better sound but they wired cord is long and get tangled on equipment.Cue the Skullcandy: After watching a review on Youtube about the best headsets for the gym, I thought I'd give these a try...and I'm so glad I did.Pros:1)Probably the best rich bass you'll get from headset and makes the Dre. Beats studio pale by comparison.2)Bluetooth - No cords, plus they maintain a 40hours of playtime, though I haven't actually tried this.3)Comfortable - The cushion around the ear is very comfortable4)Adjustable bass with a slider switch on the left ear piece and volume controls and power on the right. Honestly, lowest setting or 1/4 is more than sufficient.5)Reasonably priced by comparison to other high-end products.6)Quality Build and comfortable.Cons:1)While they have a very nice tactile feel, the soft touch ear pieces are prone to smudges.2)Bluetooth range isn't very far - About 30 feet outside the men's locker room they start cutting out. I noticed another guy at the gym with a pair of wireless Bluedio T2's (here on Amazon at a fraction of the price) and asked him how he liked them. Told me he kept his music device in his locker and the Bluetooth was strong enough that he could hit all areas of the gym without issue. This is certainly not the case with the Skull Candy and a stronger Bluetooth would be nice.3)If you are looking for Hi-Fidelity, might consider looking elsewhere. Overall a great listening experience, certainly better than Beats in my opinion but I found that sometimes for just casual listening the Bass tones seemed to resonate with a slight echo if I could call it that. To understand what I mean, if you tap the headset (no music playing) they resonate a twang which is likely a by product of the technology needed to produce those deep deep bass notes. In any case certainly not an issue, and BY FAR the best sounding set I've used.I was reserved about taking them to the gym but they completely drown out horrible testosterone destroying 80's pop music and offer way better sound than my Powerbeats with the added bonus of no cords.Upon this review I'd certainly buy these again. My laptop is bluetooth and watching Netflix with these is fantastic, it's like having a surround system with a sub for those explosions so if you are cinema watcher these are great.Had I not bought these for the gym already, I think I might have been inclined to first try the Bluedio T2s as a cheap gym set, sure not the same bass, but I don't utilize the full bass potential on these monsters either. That said, the Skull Candy with no bass boost kills the Beats in bass so I'd imagine that would be the case for most other brands as well.Five stars, well deserved. You won't be disappointed with these. Hope this review was helpful in your purchase decision.",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Casanova,graves impresionantes,"bueno bueno bueno aqu� va mi comentario que se que va ayudar a mucha gente. Despus de estar una semana viendo opiniones y reviews  y criticas y.... bueno me decid� a comprarlos  jaja, lo primero decir que estos auriculares no son para todo el mundo y ni siquiera para gente que les guste los graves, te tienen que apasionar los graves como es mi caso  ya que con el heaptic bass se come los medios  y el volumen sin el hepatic bass es algo escaso. De calidad y comodidad les doy un 8, estn muy bien construidos y son bastantes cmodos, la bater�a impresionante 3 d�as y no los he cargado y con el hepaticc bass a tope.EL SONIDO bueno con el sonido jaja cuando le� que era como ponerte un subwofer en las orejas no me lo cre�a pero es asi, con el hep�tic bass a tope es como si te pusieras  delante de los altavoces de un festival jajaja... ahora bien estos auriculares no son para todos los tipos de m�sica, lo siento mucho pero he estado tres d�as aprobndolos con todo tipo de m�sica y... no se�ores estos auriculares han sido creados para el hip hop, dub, reggae, reggaeton, dembow, techno, house.... siempre y cuando el grave este bien definido, como haya mezcla de graves es una locura porque se mezclan y te tiembla toda  la cabeza sin sentido.  Si vas a escuchar pop, flamenco, rock no son tus cascos  con el hepatic bass no se escucha nadaaa y cuando digo nada es nada enserio... ahora  con hip hop, rap y dembow con tener el hepatic bass al 25 al 50% se escucha genial porque sino se come los medios y no se escuchan las voces y si escuchas techno o house es una pasada te los puedes poner del 50 al 100% que como tenga el boom bien definido es una jodida pasada te tiembla la cabeza como si estuvieras en  un jodido festival de techno 100% recomendable si te gusta este tipo de m�sica. En el tema de multimedia (play y netflix) no me gustaron nada, se escucha bajo y mucho graves aunque ojo con las explosiones jaja. He le�do tambin que de insonorizacion fatal, pues fue la segunda cosa que mas me sorprendi me gustan como insonorizan y te a�slan muy bien.Conclusin si te gusta techno, house,hardstyle, drumb and bass, electrnica en general, hip hop, rap, trap,reggae, dembow, reggaeton... 100% recomendable y si buscas mas voces o calidad en los rangos medios y agudos  olv�date  no estar�as a gusto escuchndolo, al menos que bajes el hepatic bass al cero, pero para eso me comprar�a otros. Bueno espero que haya  sido de ayuda mi comentario. chaoooo.",4,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Mimi MikadoMimi Mikado,Vas a disfrutar como un cr�o.,"Aqu� tenis los Skullcandy Crusher, los auriculares destinados a los amantes de los bajos vibrantes. Estos son de los pocos auriculares que traen un controlador hptico, que simula el efecto de la vibracin que tiene un subwofer en una discoteca. Los otros auriculares que he probado con estas caracter�sticas son los Sony MDR-XB150N1B, los cuales adems de estar destinados a mejorar los graves, tambin tienen cancelacin de ruido activa. Vamos a compararlos y os doy un veredicto final.Ventajas:✅ Un sonido bastante decente. No me parece tan completo como el de los Sony, aunque algo que me gusta mucho es que con el controlador hptico desactivado el sonido no es tan grave como en los Sony por defecto. En comparacin a otros auriculares ms fieles al sonido plano, sus graves estn obviamente potenciados. Claramente estos auriculares estn para escuchar EDM, Trap, Hip-hop e incluso pop, as� que su finalidad la cumplen completamente. Su perfil de audio es en U, con los graves y los agudos algo ms marcados y los medios algo rebajados. Como ya he dicho, pese a que los Sony tienen los bajos ms potenciados de serie, s� creo que tienen un sonido ms limpio, al menos al usarlo con el Bluetooth. Al usar el cable la cosa cambia, pero eso lo incluir en otro punto ms adelante.✅ Controlador hptico para los bajos. En el caso de los Sony, al activar su “Bass Effect”, los graves se amplifican, pero manteniendo el resto de frecuencias presentes y con un buen nivel de calidad. Esta amplificacin hace que los auriculares vibren a partir de cierto nivel de volumen, aproximadamente un 60 o 70%. El nivel de este “Bass Effect” se regula mediante la app. Y una vez dicho esto os comento lo que hacen los Crusher, su controlador hptico hace que los auriculares vibren mucho ms que los Sony y sin necesidad de subir el volumen, incluso sin necesidad de subir el nivel de este efecto al mximo. Mientras que en los Sony tienes que subir el “Bass Effect” al mximo y a un volumen alto para que vibre, los Crusher vibran a cualquier nivel de volumen, y prcticamente con un 30% del nivel del controlador hptico, consigues el mismo efecto que en los Sony. Es decir este efecto es muuucho mayor en los Crusher, pero tienen un problema. Este efecto es artificial, no funciona bien con todas las canciones, se activa a partir de ciertas frecuencias y puede ensuciar ciertas canciones no dejando que atisbes todas las frecuencias, o incluso activndose en ciertos momentos que no debe hacerlo, destruyendo el ritmo. Esto por supuesto no ocurre con todas las canciones, apenas me ha ocurrido con un porcentaje m�nimo, quiz un 5 o un 10% de las que he probado, pero ocurre, haciendo que esa cancin deje de ser disfrutable. Los Sony por el contrario pese a que su efecto no es tan grande y “divertido”, s� es cierto que no es una vibracin artificial, as� que se pueden usar con cualquier tipo de cancin y funciona a la perfeccin. Eso s�, la regulacin del controlador hptico de los Crusher se hace mediante un botn deslizante en el panel izquierdo, y no mediante una app como en los Sony. Todo esto lo pongo en ventajas, porque pese a los defectos contados, creo que en general funciona muy bien si lo regulas adecuadamente, y me ha llegado a gustar ms que en los Sony.✅ Son plegables, ocupando menos para su transporte. Los Sony tambin.✅ Bater�a monstruosa de hasta 40 horas de duracin. Es una bater�a realmente enorme, los Sony dan 22 horas con el “Bass Effect” y el ANC activado, lo cual me parece mucho teniendo en cuenta que estas dos cualidades chupan mucha bater�a. Me imagino que las 40 horas es sin activar el controlador hptico, de todas formas me sigue pareciendo mucho.✅ Carga rpida de 3 horas de uso en 10 minutos. Los Sony no tienen carga rpida.✅ Con cable suenan much�simo mejor que con Bluetooth. Un problema que tienen los Sony es que al conectarlos por cable sin encenderlos, se pierde calidad de sonido, ni siquiera podemos disfrutar del “Bass Effect”. Estos Crusher se pueden usar con cable, sin encenderlos, con una calidad de audio superior e incluso pudiendo regular el nivel del controlador hptico. El poder usar la vibracin de las notas graves con el auricular apagado, es algo que me ha fascinado.✅ Micrfono de muy buena calidad. No me esperaba tan buen resultado en el micrfono de unos auriculares de este tipo y precio, pero es realmente bueno. El de Sony no es malo, le falta mejorar en la captacin de ruido de fondo, pero no es malo. Sin embargo los Crusher lo hacen casi perfecto, la calidad de la voz es excelente, recogindola de forma clara y potente, y apenas deja pasar el ruido exterior.✅ Son ms discretos que los Sony. Estos Crusher no ocupan mucho sobre la cabeza, son discretos para llevarlos por la calle y no llaman mucho la atencin. Los Sony por el contrario son mucho ms grandes y aparatosos, adems de que personalmente su dise�o me gusta menos.✅ Tiene multipunto, lo que te permite tener dos dispositivos conectados a la vez a los auriculares. Esto no lo tienen los Sony, y es algo que siempre me gusta tener, para poder escuchar de un dispositivo a otro sin necesidad de conectar y desconectar el bluetooth.Desventajas:❌ No tienen cancelacin de ruido activa. Esto es algo diferencial de los Sony, su cancelacin es bastante decente por su precio, he probado otros auriculares por un precio parecido con peor cancelacin. Obviamente estos Crusher no tienen cancelacin de ruido, as� que quiz no sean tan disfrutables en ambientes muy ruidosos.❌ No terminan de ser cmodos. Sus almohadillas no son de muy buena calidad, la superior es de goma y es demasiado dura, y las de las orejas no dan la misma comodidad que he probado en otros auriculares. Los Sony lo hacen mucho mejor, y eso que son ms pesados. La copa de las almohadillas es demasiado peque�a, y el espaciado para la oreja no termina de ser el suficiente. Adems de que la fuerza de pinza o “clapping” es demasiado fuerte. No aguanto ms de una hora con ellos puestos.❌ Sus botones no terminan de ser tan buenos como la competencia. Son botones, simples, grandes, con buen tacto y fciles de encontrar, pero creo que los Sony lo hacen mejor. Slo tienen 3 botones. Uno central para encender y apagar manteniendo pulsado, y para pausar o reanudar la m�sica. Los dos laterales sirven para subir o bajar el volumen con un toque, o cambiar de pista manteniendo pulsado. Juntar funciones que creo que deber�an ir separadas, como el volumen y los cambios de pista, no creo que sea lo mejor. Los Sony sin embargo tienen varios botones para cada funcin, y uno en concreto deslizable para cambiar de pista que es una delicia. Por eso, pese a que los botones no son malos, creo que los Sony lo hacen mejor, as� que lo pongo en desventajas.❌ No tienen codec de audio bluetooth APTX. Los Sony s� lo tienen, codec que garantiza una calidad de audio similar a la del CD. Estos Crusher slo tienen el cdec ms bsico que SBC.❌ No tienen giro de 90 grados para dejar reposar sobre los hombros. Los Sony s� lo tienen, aunque aprietan demasiado el cuello y no terminan de ser cmodos.❌ Los cables estn por fuera del auricular, quiz para algunos eso los haga algo feos estticamente, o les preocupe por si se rompen. Creo que es muy dif�cil que pase esto �ltimo, pero no pongo la mano en el fuego, as� que lo pongo en desventajas.❌ Traen una bolsa de transporte que es de calidad, pero habr�a preferido una funda r�gida para evitar golpes, por eso va a desventajas. Lo Sony directamente no traen nada.❌ Pesan 275 gramos. Suelo poner el l�mite en 270 gramos para tener en cuenta que un auricular es liviano, estos Skullcandy lo sobrepasan as� que va en desventajas. De todas formas los Sony son incluso ms pesados con 290 gramos.❌ No tienene NFC. Los Sony s� lo tienen.❌ No tienen una aplicacin con la que editar parmetros dentro del auricular. Los Sony tienen Headphones connect, la cual sirve para regular el “Bass Effect”, activar o desactivar el ANC, o modificar los perfiles de sonido.❌ No me gusta mantener pulsado el botn para encender o apagar el auricular. Prefiero un botn deslizante con dos posiciones que no te obligue a esperar a que el auricular se apague, o a escuchar el “power off”. Los Sony tambin tienen este tipo de botn.❌ No puedes escuchar m�sica mediante el cable USB mientras los tienes conectados al ordenador y cargndose. Los Sony tampoco, pero es algo que siempre demando.En definitiva, los recomiendo? Pues la verdad es que s�. 👍Con cual me he quedado yo? Pues me he quedado con estos Skullcandy Crusher, ya que ya tengo otros auriculares que son mejores que estos Sony en cuanto a cancelacin de ruido. Estos los quer�a para escuchar m�sica con bajos potentes en mi casa, adems de que poder usarlo con el cable sin tener que encenderlo es algo que me ha decantado por estos Crusher. Eso hace menos recomendables a los Sony? Para nada, creo que los Sony son ms completos, hechos para alguien que quiera un auricular con cancelacin de ruido y extra bass. Estos Crusher yo dir�a que son ms como un complemento para ciertas canciones y gneros, son ms disfrutables que los Sony, pero no creo que sean tan todoterreno. La nota la pondr con respecto a los precios que he estado viendo, ambos rondan los 130 o 150 euros nuevos. Seminuevos estn por aproximadamente 100 euros o algo menos.Nota calidad-precio: 9Espero que este anlisis os haya servido. Un saludo!",5,B01DWH7AIM,Colour: Gray/Tan,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Harbor S,Awesome Cans!!!!!,"The Skull Candy Crusher Wireless is a great set of cans for multiple uses. Let me say, first, we have bought 3 pairs of these in less than a year. First pair was for our 15 yo son, second pair was for my husband, and the third pair I finally bought for myself (early Xmas gift). The fact we have 3 pairs of these should say it all! All 3 pairs we bought are in black. Too many reviews had the white pair breaking, so with this last purchase, I felt there were not enough reviews with enough time on them for the new colors to make me feel confident they, too, would not break in the same spot as the white ones. So, black it was. One can never go wrong with black in headphones!The first pair was bought in early May, for a 15 yo who is not always super careful with his stuff. They've been dropped, and used every single day by him and are still working perfectly, still charge just as fast and the battery still lasts forever. They have held up to his clumsiness and look as if we bought them yesterday, though they've been dropped and dinged here and there. My husband got his the 3rd week in May and he uses his constantly. He works from home and is on the phone a LOT. Conference calls, broadcasts (radio/YouTube for interviews), and phone calls/video calls with friends both here in the States and globally. As for my husband's use - they DO work with Skype on a cell - we have Note 9s, and they DO work with Skype via the computer (for reference, he has an Asus Rog). He had to go into Skype and tell it to recognize these particular cans. They didn't work at first, but he did finally get them to. They work on all of our other call apps, WhatsApp, Wire, Signal, VSee Etc. They work with our regular phone calls beautifully too. They also connect to our Bluetooth unit we have hooked into our TV. They both connect even though we have the same headphones. We had some trouble getting 2 identical headphones connecting at first. One would automatically pick up, then we had to activate pairing mode on the headphones then press our bluetooth button on the tv unit and then it found them. Took a day to figure it out, but we did it lol! They work AWESOME with that! If you turn the bass all the way up or 3/4 of the way up, I swear, it seriously feels like you are sitting in a movie theater. The sound quality is awesome for watching tv. Often, one of us will fall asleep and to avoid waking the other, tv gets muted and headphones go on. Now, we use them even when we are both awake because they make for a great experience with the upgraded sound for the tv! Our son just keeps them connected to his phone or he uses the auxiliary cord and plugs them into his switch when he plays it. Sure beats ear buds. Plus, our son says earbuds are super uncomfortable for him and refuses to use them, so that's why we initially bought these for him.The battery life is CRAZY GOOD! This is one of the reasons we went with these 3 times. They charge up from fully drained fairly quick (a few hours) and the battery lasts FOREVER. This battery, by far, is the best out there. Nothing else to say - battery life is AMAZING.Side note - they sound even better when you go in to your cell and tweak the audio settings to your liking. On our Notes, we both had to download a good EQ/audio app and we tweaked from there. He did the same thing on his laptop, and again, amazing sound. Hes a bit of an audiophile, and while no - these aren't the top cans for an audiophile, but he is very impressed with the sound (music/tv) for the price. He actually loves these and prefers these cans for calls, watching TV, and listening to music over his top dollar Sony Noise Cancelling headphones and over his even higher priced Sennheisers. He got these because he needed a good pair with a good mic and sound for calls (as people were complaining over hearing him with the Sonys), and true cans for audiophiles, well, you can't really use them for phone calls lol. He has an expensive pair of Sennheiser cans, and once tweaked, honestly, these sounded better to me than the $400 ones. But - my ears are super sensitive to treble and it hurts my ears. So the highs not being very pronounced with these is perfect for me. The mids are definitely recognizable and neither of us have any issue with sound nor do we miss anything. When watching tv you pick up on all of the little background things you never notice. With music, you can actually hear the singer take the smallest of breaths where you couldn't before. Again, ours are tweaked for our phones and computers, BUT they are NOT tweaked for our tv, it's impossible there and we still catch every little thing.So far, the hinges are holding up. Before we purchased these for our son, we actually went to Best Buy and looked at all of the models and different brands. Skull Candy, overall, were the best for the money and comfort out of all their in-store models. When we compared these to the Venues, we went with these because they feel far more substantial than the Venues. These are heavier and feel/seem to be made sturdier than the Venues. It seems to me the only differences in the two models are - ear pieces twist out on the Venue not on the Crusher, Venue has noise cancelling and Crushers do not, Crusher has the added bass adjustment & Venues don't, and finally, the Crusher seems far strudier/a bit heavier/better made than the Venues and are cheaper than the Venues.I dont think these would be ideal for jogging or running...but I dont run anymore unless it's for my life - so, I dont run. Lol. If you put them on and tap the outside of the can, you can hear it ""reverberating"". And I've seen other reviews about hearing that while running due to the jolt of the ""bouncing"" of the body while jogging. That would irritate me. They are a little heavy, but you get used to that quickly and they are super comfy so the weight never was a bother to to me nor my husband or son. We all wear glasses/contacts. They do not hurt my ears where my earpieces are. The cups are super cushy and they only get softer/better over time. Keep in mind, these are NOT noise cancelling. But, my husband often listens to loud music 2 feet away from me and I can't say I can readily identify what he's listening to unless I got closer, so again, it's not a noticeable issue for me. When our toddler comes and crawls into bed with us, if we are watching tv, we have them on pretty loud, and it doesn't bother her a bit, even when she's got her head on my arm. Noises bother her if she's trying to go to sleep. She would, very loudly, have said something by now if she heard any sound from the headphones, or heard it loud enough. She has not.I have paid 3 different prices for these each time I purchased them. 120 for our son, 108 for hubs, and I picked them up on Cyber Monday for 79.99. Even at 120, I would buy them again and would've happily paid it for the 2nd and 3rd pairs. They are holding up really well, have great sound, and fold up for smaller storage. They come with a nice little bag that holds them, but if you want any kind of real protection so you can throw them in a bag and go, I would invest in a hard shell case for them. The bag won't protect them other than keeping them put away when not in use at home. The charge cord is good and seems to be good quality and the aux cord it comes with is really nice! The part under the jack is like a box and causes less stress on the jack and plug so it wont short out as easy. I really love the design of the auxillary cord.If you aren't too terribly rough on headphones and plan on using these for a range of things - like calls, music, & hooking into the tv - these are DEFINITELY the cans for you! They are WELL worth their price, whatever that may be. I would just invest in a hard shell case and take care of them. Most of the breakage issues I saw in reviews were with the white ones. Other colors, in my opinion, dont have enough reviews with enough time in use to be confident that they wont do the same thing the white ones seems to do. We have had zero issues with our 3 sets in black, with one son who isnt always as careful as he should be with the more expensive stuff he wants lol, and they've held up to him perfectly. These are definitely worth your hard earned money! Skull Candy did good with these!!! I would give them my money again if I needed a 4th pair for any reason. Just go on and buy them!!!!",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
ViciousVicious,This is a genuine review as an end user,"Hello allI am not a pro in sound testing.I am writing this review as normal user.Sound Quality is perfect both high and low pitch are clear when the bass slider kept at lower levelBass-This is why everybody is mad about this product, honestly speaking there is difference between bass and vibration and this beast provide tons of Vibration on bass notes which sometimes create a nuisance during converting bass to vibration.Still it is good to buy only for vibration.You will be amazed if you are watching any movie in Dolby Atmos surround certified phone/Laptop.This is beast.Battery life is superb and I dont want to discuss on that.Build Quality is good but not the best.It put some marks on the Bass key ,I have attached a photo for this.This beast is comfortable and please allow 3-4 days to adjust on your head.Noise leakage is 0.1 %out of 100.Value for money :4.9/5.0Verdict:Buy this if you are bass lover/on a go movie watcher.You wont be disappointed.If you have a budget of 18K go for the new release which having noise cancelation feature.Bass provided by this is somehow similar to Movie theaterIf you have a budget of 10 K and you are music lover just go for it",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Tom Glenn,Simply Amazing! Perfect For Commuters.,"I must admit, I've always had a preconception that Skullcandy were an overpriced brand marketed specifically at teens and I've therefore always avoided them.However, after spending hours testing various headphones in store and reading numerous reviews, I can honestly say that these headphones are amazing.The sound quality, while not as clean and accurate as say the Audio Technica MSR7s, is top notch. Especially if you are into bass heavy music, which these are clearly geared towards.The adjustable haptic bass slider is a great addition and can really take your music to the next level, providing you enjoy that sort of thing. Though I found that around half way is the sweet spot for most bass heavy songs. Beyond that it can be just too overpowering, often distorting the track. It literally feels like standing next to the speakers in a night club. Which, admittedly, isn't always a bad thing!If you're listening to these through your mobile the sound is great out of the box, however if you intend on listening to these through a computer, you may need to tweak your EQ settings. I found that through my own PC, the top end needed boosted a little as vocals felt a little drowned out by the lows. But once I'd made those tweaks they sound great wherever I listen to them.If you're a regular commuter you cannot go wrong with these. The build quality is fantastic, they look stylish and understated and they're super comfortable due to the memory foam padding. The clamp on these felt a little tight at first, but you quickly get used to it. I've worn these pretty much all day from 7am to 7pm for the past week and I've yet to experience any discomfort or overheating.For the price, I cannot recommend these headphones enough.

RobertCharlesRobertCharles,"Great bass and amazing sound quality, but there not perfect.","Amazing headphones, the bass drives deep, loud and hard, over the past month I've enjoyed them heavily, the speakers are holding up just fine with some of my deep bass tracks, but. The left earcup rattles with loud bass and recently the left earcup also cracked along the side. The build is mostly plastic but I didn't think it'd take a month to start seeing some damage. It feel's like the earcup is going well to fall off. Be careful with these and buy a harshell case for them",3,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Anand,"Head rattling bass, sparkling highs, recessed mids & a creaky construction!","Stay with my long review but I will tap on every point that will help you make a purchase decision if you are contemplating buying these.The headphones -The build is not exactly the build of an expensive set, although make no mistake, the materials used are top notch. The ear cups are soft and cozy, and they fit well on the ears. They completely envelope the ears and isolate more than 50% background noise with no music playing. The headband is soft foam on the bottom and well cushioned with a slight cutout in between to make it rest comfortably on the top of the head. The weight of the set might cause discomfort to some after extended wear. The build is all plastic with aluminium extender plates to extend the ear cups. Now as mentioned earlier, the build quality isn’t great; there is no mechanical swivel on the cups, yet they have a play which is unsettling to my mind. The play is in the hinge that holds the brackets of the cups. And they are creaky. I am not sure how long that is going to hold. It gives me the creeps to stretch the headphones holding the cups. I fear they might just break at the mount site. Otherwise, the extension of the cups holds well and tight and does not collapse inward.Upon wearing -The ear cushions are plush and feel expensive. The first thing you notice is they sit firm and tight. But the clamping force is extreme. It causes jawline pain in few minutes and although they aren’t uncomfortable to wear, the clamping force might be an issue for some because it causes a pressure effect up to the temporal bones. Removing them and doing some facial exercises does relieve the borderline pressure pain. More on that in an update after I use it for a few days.Buttons-A big thumbs up for the button placement. On the right ear cup you’ll find three buttons for play/pause, vol up and down and they are exceptionally well placed and ergonomically perfect. I take my palm up to the cup and my thumb by default finds the centre button without fetching for it. The buttons have a beautiful travel and have a satisfying click to them. The action is instant without any lag. A big plus IMO, since my Sennheiser headphones make me fetch for buttons every time even after a year of use.Sound -Day 1 : This is a first day review. Let me start with bass. With the slider at lowest level, the bass is good. Without engaging the bass slider, they are definitely tuned to pump more bass than any other headphone I have heard. The highs are good too. The vocals are clearly recessed right from the get go. This affects instrumentation too. Cymbals sound good. Engaging the bass slider does not cause too much of a difference in the initial 50% if you’re listening at a volume lower than 40-50% on your amp. I don’t know if it’s an issue with my unit, but sliding the slider in the initial 50% does nothing to pump bass if the volume is 50% or less. The bass kicks in and remains active only if the volume is 50% and more. If the volume is less than 50%, and I engage the bass slider to anything less than 50%, the bass does kick in, but after a pause or skip of track, where the music stops in between, the bass goes back to minimum. It does not retain it’s level. Be aware the bass is boomy and it likely boosts ranges 50Hz and above and doesn’t quite elevate levels lower than that. I am not a fan of booming bass at all and I was expecting sub-bass levels to be pumped, which, at least at day one use, doesn’t seem to be the case.Update : Day 3: I can confirm that the bass slider does not engage below 50% of volume if the slider is also below 50%. Once the slider hits 50% mark, the bass suddenly kicks in. There isn’t a smooth transition in the bass as you would expect. If you want the slider to work smoothly, the volume has to be at the level of 60-70%, which for me is too loud. Some people might be comfortable with it. Now I don’t know how this behaviour will change with time, but I don’t think it will. I believe this goes down to the way the bass is created. They need some volume to start with the reverberation effect.After nearly 12 hours of burn-in time, I can confirm the bass has improved significantly in quality. I will put it down to better excursion. The bass still continues to be boomy. But it reaches deeper levels now. It has become tighter compared to the first day of listening. It still isn’t hard hitting and anything above 50% on the slider causes the sound to become boomy and to overshadow other frequencies. Frankly, it is not about being a bass head or not, I myself crave for bass in music, but even for bass lovers, there should be something else listenable in the music other than relentless booming and reverberations, which isn’t the when case when the slider is anything beyond 60%.So basically, with the volume under 60%, and the bass slider under 50%, the bass does not kick in, and with the slider above 60% all you can hear is booming and severely suppressed vocals and instrumentation. Although the higher frequencies (treble) still their own since those frequencies are also boosted at baseline.To sum it up-If you are a bass lover and don’t quite care about sound signature, these are a phenomenal set of headphones. If you find a sweet spot, the bass can be kept at enjoyable levels and the music and movies become quite immersive, but the slider is nothing more than a gimmick under 60-70% volume. The bass is quantitative not qualitative and is loose and sloppy, not tight and responsive. The highs are fairly well balanced with the bass, so if you like a V shaped curve on the EQ, you will be pleased with these headphones. They are made for a very niche category of people.I hope you find this helpful.",4,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
KevKev,FANTASTIC headphones. Would recommend 100%,"Pros:Very beautiful sound quality headphones, very long lasting battery, wireless lasts a very very long time, and the bass is just out of this world! I used other name brand headphones from friends or even personally owned, and this is worth the money. Connects to mobile devices, your computer, laptop, Xbox One controller, etc. with the 3.5mm cable.Cons:For the money, I wish there would be a batter indicator, even if it's with an app, while using the Bluetooth to know where the batter is at. Also, while using the headphone jack you can skip songs by double clicking the button BUT when wireless, none of the buttons skip to the next song. It's ONLY volume, bass, and power buttons. Pushing the power button while wireless pauses the music but does not skip the track. (Separate note, my headphones were a LITTLE bit malfunctioned with the ear cups and no one ever offered a replacement so it's whatever at this point. You can see from the bottom of my left ear cup fitting perfectly BUT the right ear cup has a little lump on it. You can't feel it but just not being symmetrical bothers me since just because of the price you pay for these headphones)Only 2 complaints but other than that, it's very very solid and I love them very much. If you're a sweaty person, just clean the headsets properly so they last longer without tearing apart. Skullcandy, if you make more headphones like these, PLEASE add a battery indicator.",5,B01DWH7AIM,Colour: Gray/Tan,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Abhinav Pandey,Deserves the tag of the flagship product for SkullCandy,"If you're considering to buy any product from Skullcandy, you like bass and warm tones of music, you're not a hard core audiophile but you love a product that stands justified for its cost. You want an unapologetic, power-packed, behemoth of a product that satisfies your urges of a great listening without creating a hole in your pocket( cases in point- Beats, Sennheiser, Bang and Olufsen etc.). You're paying 9500 bucks for this product and that is still a lot of money but the product is worthy of the amount paid.Unlike its predecessor, the product quality is better. The crusher line of headphones are known for the vibration that comes along with the bass but Crusher wireless sounds better than the others without the haptics turned on. Sometimes, you can hear the spring when you gently tap the headphones, which is a little annoying. When you turn on the haptics the middle notes get a little muddy, it might also be because of the vibration but it's there. If you're not an audiophile, you'll find these amazing. It's less bulkier than the Wired crushers. In summary, a high end product of low end brand is always better than a low end product of a high end brand.PROSMind blowing bass40 hours of battery and more, if you do not use the haptics quite as much.Connectivity is amazing,Great for long hours listening.Adequate for watching movies and playing games.There is option for multiple pairing as well.(You can pair multiple devices at once)Better Design with plush materialsComes with a 3.5 mm jack for an option of wired listening.CONSYou can hear the haptic spring sometimes.Muddy middle notes with haptics turned on.",4,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
AlfiAlfi,THE REAL HEADPHONE FOR BASS LOVERS....,"I am writing this review after 2 months of usage and experience......First I will say the pros...1. Amazing sound quality2. Mind blowing battery life3. The bass and bass control feature4. Portability5. Hassle free connectivity6. Premium look7. Soft ear cushion8. Charging indicator ( Red & Green )9. Even though it doesn’t have noise canceling feature it does blocks some soundNow I will talk about the cons....1. While using for the first time, it feels uncomfortable , but I guarantee you once you get used to it like 3,4 weeks you will surely love it2. If you are using this head phone while walking(hard) , you can hear some spring noise sort of thing ( when the music is at very low volume or when the headphone is off)3. Sometimes when you watch movies over the Bluetooth and when the bass ( very low ) kicks in some sort of distortion is heard , but when switched to aux the audio is much betterNow I will talk why I chose skull candy over Sony XB-950BT1. Sony has very flimsy body2. Doesn’t have bass control feature, Believe me you will never have to use 100% bass in these headphones, so skullcandy has the functionality right at your fingertip while the Sony is through the app �3. Batter lifeWith one charge it would probably go for 3,4 weeks of normal ( 50% base , Bluetooth, medium volume ) useIn 2 months I’ve only charges it 4 times....we can still enjoy music even when the headset is dead and too having the bass control featureFinal thoughts....I would really really recommend this headset for bass lovers and those whose are addicted to music especially EDM.....Once you get used with this headphone you will never feel like you wasted your moneyREAL VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT ��",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Jack,Total black e bassi esagerati,"Ho preso le cuffie mesi fa, non avevo intenzione di scrivere una recensione, ma non resisto, quando una cosa � fatta bene � giusto che si sappia. Il packaging � di grande stile, total black come le cuffie e molto curato. Le cuffie sono, per me, le pi� belle sul mercato. Superfici pulite e forme semplici, con materiali ottimi e una disposizione dei tasti comoda. Poi � total black, ma proprio total, non c'� neanche un particolare di un altro colore, a parte ovviamente i led. La connessione bluetooth funziona benissimo, si abbina in un attimo e non da problemi, e soprattutto non si sente differenza nella qualit� rispetto alla connessione via cavo. La batteria � infinita, le carico una volta al mese. I cuscinetti avvolgono bene le orecchie, ma essendo delle cuffie abbastanza compatte, non sono di quel tipo che anche dopo ore non si sente niente, ogni tanto bisogna spostarle per non sentire fastidio. Questo � l'unico compromesso da accettare con queste cuffie, ma se non si vuole un prodotto ingombrante non c'� di meglio, sono comunque molto pi� comode di tutte le on ear. Per quanto riguarda l'aspetto pi� importante che � la resa sonora, posso dire che ho provato le Beats, le AKG, le Sennheiser, e queste nella categoria di prezzo a cui vengono vendute sono secondo me le migliori, con un particolare in pi� che � quello dei bassi esagerati. Non avevo mai provato una sensazione del genere con delle cuffie, � come essere ad un metro dalle casse in un club, � divertentissimo alzare i bassi con i pezzi giusti, anche se difficilmente si riesce a resistere per molto se si alzano al massimo. Conclusione: ne comprerei un altro paio solo per non rischiare di rimanere senza se andassero fuori produzione e le mie si rompessero.",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
RedmondIvy,UPDATED REVIEW:  PLEASE READ.  CAN'T RECOMMEND.,"UPDATE (7/23/18):  I've had these for about 3-4 days.  I wrote a glowing review based on my first day of use.  Although,  I'm afraid after a few hours of use I have to say these aren't worth the money and not something I would use or could use.  Here are a list of things I realized and found out after using them.1.  They literally crush your head.  They are very tight.  My son who is 15 has a pair and I have a pair.  Both of us complained of getting headaches and almost nauseous due to how tight they are on your head.  I've heard of some saying that they loosen up over a period of use, but I'm not going to wait it out.  They. are. tight.2.  NO MID RANGE.  High's are highs and lows are lows... but no mid.  I tested the headphones with my PS4 playing Ghost Recon Wildlands and Far Cry 5 and the guns sound flat.  Yes, the bass is punching you in the head but that's about all you hear and feel.  I thought maybe I was crazy so I pulled out my Cloud 2's and switched back and forth for about 30 minutes.  I shot guns, threw grenades, tested the scope of sound (hearing ambient effects around you) and honestly, the Cloud 2's in my opinion kill these.  The Cloud 2's don't have the thunderous bass that the Crushers do but they have a awesome mid range where you can feel and hear the gun shot, grenade explosions, etc.  This only was one of the major reason's I couldn't keep the Crushers.  I cannot recommend these for gaming.  Especially for long sessions.3.  I can't pair them with my TV, PS4, XBOX One.  Yes I hear you can get a dongle to assist in pairing the Crushers but I don't want to go that route.  I did use the wire that comes with the Crushers but there's a difference in sound between wired and bluetooth.4.  Music sounds great .... For awhile.  I missed that mid-range and true bass.  These do not have true bass.  The bass is like listening to someone having a party behind a cement wall.  There's just something off about it.  You can only handle so much.5.  HERE's the one where I can honestly say the Crushers kick butt.  Pairing these with your iPad or iPhone and watching a action flick on Netflix.  Tested it with Star Wars and the explosions and dialogue sounded great.  Although, I did plug them into my PS4 controller via the wire that comes with it and tried watching Netflix and there seemed to be a loss in quality of sound.  Switched back to bluetooth through my iPad and boom sound was thunderous and movies haven't sounded better.  Like sitting in a IMAX theater.6.  All in all, we returned the Crushers.  For the money, I'd rather save some more cash and get some Astros with an AMP or use my Cloud 2's and hook them up through a small receiver which is also connected to my PS4 and turn those bad boys up and get all the bass I need but with Mid's and Highs.I just can't recommend these.  I think the reviews are like myself... blown away the first few hours but then reality sinks in and you kind of realize what your dealing with.  It's sort of a gimmick and you can get better headphones with a less bass and still be quite happy.Original Review:I did a week's worth of research looking all over the internet for anyone really going into detail on whether the Crushers were a good gaming headset.  Well, now that I have them, I can safely say...  OH YEAH!  So here's a quick backstory...  I have been on the search for a pair of headphones that would allow me to feel the explosions, feel the bones crunching.  I have tried the Playstation Golds, Clouds, Astros, Sans, Sonys and none of them really had a deep pounding bass.  Don't get me wrong, all of them are great headphones.  I specifically bought the Cloud II's because to me for the price they had the best balance of sound and bass.  Saying that,  my son came running out of Best Buy and told me I had to try the Crushers.  Honestly, I laughed at him.  NO way.  I'll never buy Skull Candy or Beats.  Not for gaming.  I went anyway and holy crap did they rattle your head.  BUT, I still questioned whether they would produce good mid's and high's and would the bass actually sound good while gaming on my PS4.  So, my son ordered a pair on Amazon and they showed up today (7/19).  We plugged them into the PS4 and fired up Mad Max which has some awesome explosions and the cars rumble hard....  OH Man was it like nothing I've heard in a headphone.  The shotgun was deep and powerful.... The cars rumbled.  I mean rumbled.  Not a distorted bass but clean deep overpowering rumble.  Just awesome.So, after trying them and testing them...  A few things popped out...1.  The bass is truly something else.  Powerful.  I actually turned it all the way down to around 10% and it was just as good.  So imagine at 10% what it would feel like at 75%... It's nuts.2.  The PS4 has always had a issue with not really allowing headphones to really go 'LOUD'.  It's like it limits the volume to a certain extent and then stops.  You can't go louder.  Same scenario with the crushers.  I was loud but not as loud as I would like it.  I compared them to our cloud II's and same situation.  We are aware they are bluetooth but still trying to figure out how to connect them to the PS4.  I'm sure that would fix the volume issue.  So because of this... the mid's and high's weren't incredibly loud but completely doable.3.  Sound bleed was honestly very quiet.  My son had them cranked and I could not hear them.  Not bad.  So my wife won't get irritated while watching a movie on my iPad right next to her.4.  THINK IMAX SOUND in your ears while watching an action movie.  No joke, explosions and someone getting a kick in the face is felt.  John Wick and Equalizer is awesome with the crushers.Bottom line.  Well made, great sound, amazing bass like nothing I've heard.  For movies and games, no brainer in my book.  For music, even better.  BUT, keep in mind, it's not a true bass so for bass heads... these are awesome but for music purists...  I'd try something else.Gaming with these is just awesome.  Experience it.",3,B01DWH7AIM,Colour: Gray/Tan,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

When contacted SkullCandy they simply said they cannot do anything about it even when I am ready to pay money for service.

dumauchdmaskdumauchdmask,Don't sound too great and break after a few months,I ordered these because my bluedio Victory's are too clunky and i prefer the more minimalist design of the crushers. The unfortunate trade off is that sound quality isn't that great. I have tried cheaper headphones with less distortion in the sound. The mids are also barely present. Volume doesn't get that loud either. The connectivity seems good though. I also like that it pairs quite quickly. The headset is quite light and thats good for portability but it feels flimsy and doesn't seem very durable. The base is crazy and with the right misic it produces rich audio but with the wrong music it sounds muddy and lacks clarity. Call quality its a pro and when i call even over WhatsApp people say i sound much more clear than other headphones. All in all I'd say that there are better options out there for less money unless you favor bass and sleek design(which is subjective).UPDATE!!!!!!!!!DON'T BUY THESE FOR LONG TERM USE!!!!!!!!!The ear cups broke after 6 months now the hinge is broken and it hasn't been a year. I know bluedio is getting flack for its new products but trust me these won't last as long. The plastic is super flimsy. For this price you can find much better that sound just as good.,1,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Wolfsherz,Alter Schwede. Das ist einfach nur der Wahnsinn....WOW,"Ich hatte in meinem leben sehr, sehr viele kopfhrer. Alle namhaften Hersteller, von B&O, Bose, Bowers Wilkins, Sennheiser, Sony und co. Zur Zeit nutze ich den Bose QC35 und Sennheiser Momentum 2.0Dann habe ich den Test bei Stiftung Warentest gelesen, weil ich mal was neues ausprobieren wollte. Diese Kopfhrer wurden sehr gelobt. Vor allem weil man die Mglichkeit hat den Bass durch Haptischen Feedback zu spr�ren, wenn man will. Man kann es auch abschalten.Von der Klangqualit�t hatte ich nicht viel erwartet.Kopfhrer kamen an. Aufgesetzt: F�hlen sich straff und Stabil an, es klappert nichts. Polsterungen sind sehr weich und angenehm. Bose hat hier noch die Nase vorn.Aber jetzt kommt es: Ich kopple die Kopfhrer, was schnell und einfach ging. Einen Techno Track gestartet. Und dann kam der Hammer. So einen Intensiven Bass habe ich noch nie in meinem Leben aus Kopfhrern gehrt.Pr�zise Trocken, Tief.Nur wenn man den Bassregler auf Anschlag dreht, wird es etwa unpr�zise und Boomy. Aber so extremen B�sse will man sich nicht auf die dauer antun. Wenn man den Bass runterregelt ist der Klang wieder absolut Sauber und Pr�zise.Ich dachte einfach nur WOW. Das war echt ein neues Hrerlebnis. Klar kann man das kaum auf die dauer aushalten, weil einem die Sch�deldecke wegzufliegen droht. Aber f�r Abwechslung und ein neues Erlebnis, einfach nur perfekt.Wenn man dann keine lust mehr hat auf diesen unfassbaren Bass, kann man es wunderbar herunterregeln und sie hren sich dann wie normale hochwertige Kopfhrer an.Hhen und mitten sind auch sehr Pr�szise und differenziert. Der Sound ansich kann locker mit den Grossen namen wie Sennheiser oder Bose mithalten.Ich habe viele Tracks angehrt, von Klassik, Jazz, Pop, HipHop bis TEchno. Wunderbarer klang !!!Ich mchte hier auch kein Sinnloses beschreiben vom Sound versuchen, wie man es oft liest. Was die leute da manchmal f�r einen Bldsinn zusammenschreiben ist schon bemerkenswert. Die leute haben halt Fantasie :)Ich kann nur sagen: Sounderlebnis ist Extrem gut.Die Akkulaufzeit ist auch exorbitant. Ich komme auf l�nger als 40 Stunden. Laut Stiftung Warentest, sind es sogar 61 Stunden.Ganz kleiner kritikpunkt ist das Gewicht. Sie sind recht schwer mit 300 gramm. Aber haben mich nicht gestrt.Ich kann ganz klar sagen, wer mal was neues erleben will, mit einem WOW effekt, wird begeistert sein.Diese Kopfhrer haben es geschafft, dass ich die Bose und Sennheiser beiseite gelegt habe.Derzeit klar meine Lieblings Kopfhrer.",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Rachit Shah,crazy bass levels - ridiculous battery life - good sound isolation for a passive system - easy to ...,"Bought these as an upgrade to my Bose soundsport headphones which lacked in bass and were wired.PROS- secondary driver adds a LOT of punch, crazy bass levels- ridiculous battery life- good sound isolation for a passive system- easy to pairCONS- felt like it wasn't really ""clean"" bass and kind of sounded muffled like an old car subwoofer- secondary driver doesn't hit all the lowest frequencies. In some songs with a lot of background bass I found the secondary driver fading away for the deeper tones, which is more noticeable the higher you turn the slider. This really made some songs sound terrible- can't turn bass slider up more than 20% without drowning out the rest of the music- maybe headphones aren't for me, but my ears were stuffed and in pain after about an hour with these on, definitely not as comfortable as the Bose earbuds- noticeable lack in sharpness in the mids and treble compared to the BoseOverall, I think these are solid headphones, but didn't end up feeling like an upgrade to my Bose earbuds which were half the price. The heavily altered sound profile definitely provides some kick, but takes away other important aspects of the sound.

Dani83,Woooooow!!!,"Ci tenevo a fare questa recensione... allora, dopo innumerevoli prove di altre cuffie, decido di comprare queste senza provarle, basandomi solo sulle recensioni. Fortuna o sesto senso non potevo scegliere di meglio. Ho provato ogni beats wireless, dalle solo alle studio, poi le bose quietcomfort... secondo il mio punto di vista, le skullcandy crusher wireless se le mangiano. Le beats impastano un po il suono, le bose sono cristalline, ma hanno un volume massimo decisamente basso. Le skull sono una BOMBAAA. I bassi fanno tremare il cervello, mai sentito nulla di simile in una cuffia, sembra di avere un subwoofer nelle orecchie, ma diversamente da altri modelli dello stesso brand fin'ora prodotti, hanno medi ben definiti ed alti cristallini. Il volume � molto alto quando si usano bluetooth, quando invece si attacca il cavo aux, si abbassa un pochino, forse perch� accendendole si attiva anche un piccolo amplificatore digitale. Quindi funzionano moooolto meglio senza fili che col filo, forse � la prima cuffia che che lo fa. Quindi, per chi ha deciso di acquistare una cuffia senza fili, con un ottimo isolamento esterno, potentissima e leggera, con un ottimo rapporto qualit� prezzo, per me non pu� scegliere di meglio... un mega applauso alla skullcandy per l'ottima riuscita sotto ogni aspetto per queste skullcandy crusher wireless.",5,B01DWH7AIM,Colour: Gray/Tan,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Battery life is the best that you can get on any bluetooth headset right now. When it turns on and off you can see a purple light indicator. And if you put them on you can hear it say that its on.To connect with a device you have to press and hold the power key for 3 seconds then it will show the bt headset on your device.When its searching for bt device it blinks red and blue light indicator.When its charging red light indicates charging and after 2 and a half hour it will fully charge and green light will indicate that its fully charged.If you compare with other brands within this price range none can compete with it. I have used Sony / BoAt / Jbl etc but this is something.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GAMING USE I WILL SUGGEST THAT USE IT WITH WIRES. THERE IS A 3.5 MM JACK WITH A BUILT IN MIC IN THE BOX. USE IT FOR BETTER GAMING EXPERIANCE.Pros : *Good sound quality.*best battery life.*bass you really feel with adjustable bass slider.* premium quality.* will not fall from your headCons: when you use it for the first time it will clam your head hard. After 1 or 2 days of usage it becomes normal.The haptic engine that provides the head shaking bass comes fraction of a second late.*** if you are looking for a headphone for listening music and enjoy like its party everytime. Buy it now. Its for fun listening and enjoying life.***# the plastic joints broke after 6 months.. So be careful...!!!,5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Amazon Customer,My Honest review from Bangalore after a year usage.,"I am gonna quote 3 main reasons for you not to go for this product.1. Skull Candy Service: I really regret buying this product because of very bad skull candy service.First of all there is only one service center in India and is located in Noida, New Delhi. They initially ask you to mail them the problems u faced with your head phones and they reply you after a week or sometimes never. Then they will ask you to send the product to them and they also mention ""if product goes missing during delivery they are not responsible"". By now you will be stressed up thinking if u have wasted your investment on this headphones or not.2. Build Quality: Most of the products out there is made out of plastic but here they have used very very cheap quality plastic at the hinges so it just breaks even if u r handling with care.3.  Audio Quality: Bass is really good, it literally tickles ur ears but you won't enable bass for more than 10 minutes because bass reduces vocal sound or other instrument sounds you are listening to.Yes it's been a year since i bought it and never really used it because of the problems i faced.So from my experience in music and gaming field i would like recommend Sony, Sennheiser or Audio Technica.Thank You.",1,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Tony CastanoTony Castano,La rivoluzione dei bassi - Non per i puristi,"Skullcandy � un brand abbastanza conosciuto nel settore audio, soprattutto grazie ai suoi prodotti di ottima qualit� che strizzano l'occhio ad un'utenza giovane ed anche un po' ribelle.Oggi parlo di un modello di cuffie Skullcandy molto promettente, che col suo claim ""Bass you can feel"" promette delle frequenze basse da capogiro: sto parlando delle Skullcandy Crusher Wireless, un modello che non vedevo l'ora di provare in quanto amante dei bassi corposi.##Unboxing e prime impressioniMa andiamo con ordine. Le Crusher Wireless arrivano in una scatola con chiusura magnetica al cui interno troviamo:- le Crusher Wireless,- un sacchettino morbido ed imbottito per il trasporto,- un cavo USB-microUSB per la ricarica,- un cavo con doppio jack audio da 3.5mm per usarle in maniera corded,- manualistica rapida.La dotazione prevede tutto il necessario per una cuffia di questo livello, tuttavia un case rigido sarebbe stata una chicca apprezzata.Il primo approccio � sicuramente piacevole. In questa colorazione total black opaca, le Crusher Wireless si presentano piacevoli alla vista con un design moderno, sportivo e minimale. Risultano ben costruite, piuttosto leggere grazie al sapiente utilizzo di plastica e non differiscono troppo da una cuffia qualsiasi, pur non trattandosi di una cuffia qualsiasi.Gli ingressi per jack audio e cavo microUSB sono posizionati sul padiglione sinistro, insieme ad un piccolo microfono ed allo slider per il controllo dei bassi. Sul destro, invece, troviamo un piccolissimo LED di stato multicolore, appena sopra i tasti per aumentare ed abbassare il volume ed il pulsante multifunzione per accenderle, spegnerle o richiamare la modalit� accoppiamento.##Design, comfort e costruzioneIl design di queste Crusher Wireless mi piace tantissimo: le linee risultano sobrie, semplici e pulite ma con un tocco di carattere grazie alla colorazione nera opaca. In questo senso sono perfette per il target giovane a cui sono rivolte.La costruzione vede un sapiente mix di plastica e metallo: all'esterno tutto � in plastica, morbida al tocco e leggera per aumentare il comfort, mentre allungando i padiglioni � possibile intravedere la struttura interna metallica.Lo slider per controllare i bassi � piuttosto preciso grazie alla lunga corsa, ma risulta un po' traballante in quanto a costruzione.Un'altra cosa che non mi � piaciuta � che i cavi che collegano i due padiglioni all'archetto sono in vista, quindi � possibile tirarli e romperli per sbaglio. Esteticamente per� non danno troppo fastidio.I padiglioni sono in plastica, possono essere allungati a piacimento e si adattano facilmente anche ad un testone come il sottoscritto. Il sistema di allungamento risulta un po' duro, molto difficile allungarle direttamente in testa, conviene allungarle prima di indossarle.I padiglioni non possono essere appiattiti ma possono essere richiusi per dimunuire le dimensioni durante il trasporto.Il comfort � un altro aspetto molto positivo di queste Skullcandy Crusher Wireless: l'imbottitura dei padiglioni � ottima, spessa e morbidissima. Si tratta di una cuffia over-ear, quindi l'orecchio entra all'interno del padiglione per un comfort elevato. Finora non ho sudato indossandole, ma questo aspetto � da verificare nelle stagioni pi� calde.Ottima anche l'imbottitura sotto l'archetto.Ultimo appunto sulla pressione dei padiglioni sulla testa: chiamandosi Skullcandy Crusher temevo che questa potesse essere un problema, invece ho trovato che siano tarate ottimamente, non cos� tanto da procurare dolori ma nemmeno appena appoggiate, col rischio che un movimento improvviso possa farle cadere.##Funzionamento e resa sonoraLa connessione Bluetooth delle Crusher Wireless � stabile e tiene bene i 10 metri dichiarati da Skullcandy. Non c'� il codec AptX ma onestamente non ho mai notato differenze esaltanti nei modelli con tale codec.Pi� significativa per alcuni potrebbe essere la mancanza dell'NFC, che avrebbe consentito un rapido accoppiamento, ma si tratta di 10 secondi in pi�.C'� anche una voce guida per aiutarci durante le operazioni classiche di tutti i device audio con Bluetooth.C'� da fare una premessa prima di parlare della qualit� audio: ci sono due modi di ""interpretare"" queste Skullcandy Crusher Wireless, da audiofilo purista o da amante dei bassi (che si presume sia il target che Skullcandy voglia conquistare). Io mi ritengo un po' entrambi, apprezzo un suono puro ed adatto ad ogni tipo di musica, ma non nego una predisposizione verso le tonalit� basse che risultano pi� divertenti e coinvolgenti per le mie orecchie.Da purista, queste cuffie sono ""normali"". Il suono risulta ovviamente enfatizzato nei bassi, ma senza per� penalizzare le altre frequenze. I medi sono ottimi e danno molto corpo all'audio, gli alti sono buoni seppur manchi quel tocco di nitidezza che le avrebbe rese qualcosa di pi�. I bassi sono leggermente pi� presenti del normale, ma riescono ad essere tenuti a bada tramite lo slider.Da bass-addicted, queste cuffie sono invece una rivoluzione. Ascoltare electro, house, trap, dubstep con queste Crusher Wireless � una vera e propria esperienza. I bassi sono potentissimi, la sensazione � quella di quando vai per la prima volta al cinema e parte un trailer ricco di esplosioni, col subwoofer che fa tremare l'intera sala. Ecco le Crusher Wireless smuovono qualcosa nelle orecchie, i bassi non si ascoltano, si sentono addosso, si sperimentano sulla propria pelle. Rendono l'attesa del drop qualcosa di unico, ho provato a guardare un video di Tomorrowland e sembrava quasi di essere l�.Il segreto � regolare i bassi ad un livello adatto: personalmente non ho mai impostato lo slider oltre la met�. Oltre i bassi risultano eccessivi ed assolutamente non necessari.Posso provare a farvi capire perch non dovete usarle mai con i bassi al massimo volume: avete presente quelle auto modificate con impianti audio decisamente esagerati per una macchina, i cui bassi si sentono a chilometri di distanza? Ecco la sensazione � la stessa. I bassi sono davvero troppo spinti e, a meno che non vi riconoscete nel tipo di persona col subwoofer sempre a palla, vi sconsiglio di utilizzarli cos�.Le Crusher Wireless possono essere utilizzate con una certa soddisfazione anche per film e giochi, grazie a questi bassi veramente goduriosi ed un buon soundstage. Ecco il soundstage � solo buono perch in alcuni casi la separazione degli strumenti non � precisissima, soprattutto ai massimi livelli di volume.Molto buona anche l'insonorizzazione passiva, grazie gli ampi padiglioni ed un'imbottitura in grado di evitare che i rumori esterni disturbino la nostra riproduzione musicale. Meno bene all'esterno, dove a volumi sostenuti passa molta musica e chi ci � vicino potrebbe ascoltare distintamente la nostra playlist musicale.Per concludere parliamo di autonomia: Skullcandy dichiara 40 ore, un dato strabiliante ma che ho potuto verificare in queste settimane di test.A seconda del volume di ascolto si possono fare dalle 35 alle 40 ore di ascolto musicale; ovviamente, in caso di batteria scarica, si potr� collegare il cavo ed utilizzare le cuffie all'infinito in modalit� corded, e lo slider dei bassi funzioner� senza problemi.##ConclusioneLe Skullcandy Crusher Wireless sono delle cuffie rivoluzionarie, almeno per chi ama i bassi enfatizzati e morbidissimi. Non ho ancora ben capito come Skullcandy ci sia riuscita, a quanto ho capito si tratta di un meccanismo che prevede delle molle nei padiglioni, ma non capire non significa non godersele.Ho apprezzato ogni secondo con queste Crusher Wireless e non ho paura ad ammetterlo. Sono cuffie per tutti? Sicuramente no. I puristi dell'audio non riusciranno ad ascoltarle nemmeno per 30 secondi, ma sarebbe ingiusto giudicare le Crusher Wireless come un purista, quando il target � praticamente opposto.Sono cuffie per i bass-addicted, per chi vuole sentire la testa tremare, per chi vuole divertirsi e magari stupire i propri amici. Ho fatto ascoltare queste cuffie ad un paio di miei amici e le reazioni sono state esilaranti...Il prezzo di 150 di listino (135 qui su Amazon al momento della recensione) � secondo me onestissimo anche senza questa rivoluzione dei bassi. Hanno dalla loro un'ottima autonomia, un buon comfort in quanto over ear e sono wireless, gi� solo questo basterebbe a giustificare il prezzo.Non sono cuffie perfette, ma i difetti sono marginali: Skullcandy � pronta a dominare il mercato bass-oriented.PRO- Bassi strepitosi- Autonomia eccellente- Comfort elevato- Design sobrio ma piacevole- Ottimo rapporto qualit�-prezzoCONTRO- Non per tutti- Manca l'NFC",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Amazon CustomerAmazon Customer,Nice but don't expect much !,"I read and read a lot about it before I brought one . Because I love bass and Bose QC has all what music has to offer, but for me it was life less without the heavy bass note ( owned nothing but Bose till date)  . I needed bass to boost my spirits up. Hence opted this after my research on various head phones.Truth : keep the bass at Max : u guys gonna hate it ! Noisy , no clarity with vocals , just flat vibrations on ur ears ( I ain't comparing the voice clarity with Bose or any other head phones , it's just generic ) . Overall u can't enjoy music .My question is : why would some one wanna do that ? U just can't hear a thing !!!!!!It's a nice thing that it's got a bass level adjuster .Keep it on mid note or slightly lower (would recommend 40%)You will love what an ear phone has to offer with respect to the bass front .Would feel like u are taking a 2:1 woofer and walking along . ( Dont over expect the bass , but it's good ! (Not awesome or mind blowing)I'm satisfied with the performance as at 40% the bass is lovely , strong enuf to pump me up and at the same time , the vocals and music of various diverse frequency is heard clearly !I'm giving it a four star coz this sucks at high bass boost .But at the same time , I ain't regretting for having brought it.Go for it . Be polite with ur bass expectations , if so you will love it ! ;-)Hope u guys found it helpful",4,B01DWH7AIM,Colour: Gray/Tan,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
DonA,Solide Kopfhrer von Skullcandy,"Ich habe einige Kopfhrer getestet von JBL bis Bose und habe mich letztendlich f�r die Skullcandy Variante entschieden. Wieso?Zu n�chst sei gesagt, dass mein Musikgeschmack eher in die Richtung Rock/Metal geht. Das ist denke ich f�r manche wichtig. Denn f�r Klassik Fans ist der Kopfhrer nichts.Ich habe nach Kopfhrer gesucht mit Bass. Das war mein Anspruch. JBL hat hier oft das nachsehen, da hier mehr wert auf gute Hhen gesetzt wird welches auch nicht verkehrt ist. Hier haben die Skullcandys auch meiner Meinung nach ihre Schw�che. Der Sound ist aber sehr satt und meiner Meinung nach f�r den Hausgebrauch genau richtig. Bose �bertrifft zwar vom Sound her nicht viele, aber daf�r bezahlt man auch mindestens das doppelte. Ich wollte aber Kopfhrer zum Musik hren zu Hause, wenn ich putze oder koche ohne das meine Lebensgef�hrtin oder Nachbarn aus den Wolken fallen. Daf�r sind die perfekt. Guter satter Bass und Tragekomfort stimmen . Hatte sie jetzt nicht l�nger auf als 2 Stunden am St�ck, aber auch als Brillentr�ger nicht unangenehm.Die manuelle Einstellung f�r den Bass ist gut, obwohl ich mir hier eher eine Software Lsung gew�nscht h�tte, weil es ein mechanischer schalter ist, der meiner Meinung nach nicht ewig halten wird. Die volle Basspower brauche ich nicht und finde auch er ist dann zu dominant. Ansonsten kann man nicht meckern, obwohl die Hhen besser sein knnten. Dann w�ren sie perfekt.Der Akku h�lt je nach Bass k�rzer als die Angabe. �ber die Klinkenfunktion habe ich noch nicht getestet, trage ich aber evtl. nach.Wer also kein JBL, Bose oder gar Beats Verfechter ist und Kopfhrer mit ordentlich bums sucht wird mit den skullcandys gl�cklich werden. Wer viel Hrbucher, Klassik oder Videos gucken mchte sollte meiner Meinung nach zu anderen greifen.",4,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

KC H.KC H.,"Great headphones, love them.","I bought these after I bought the sony XB950BT headphones and wanting more bass. Having  both to compare side by side the XB950BT's are more comfortable to wear as I find that these squeeze bit but that could just be me. I personally find them louder and crisper than the sony's also.The bass is just crazy. I've never experienced anything like it in a pair of headphones before. The fact that you can adjust the bass accordingly to each song is perfect. They have two drivers in each earcup one main 40mm @ 32 ohms and a 32mm ""crusher"" driver @ 13 ohms.  They vibrate your whole head and feels like you have subwoofer strapped to you. When I first tried them out and I put the slider up I had a constant smile on my face of joy and disbelief.You get up to 40hrs battery life. The bass and mic still works when using the cable is just a bonus plus it comes with a case. None of which the Sony does.My only negative point is the bass frequency range of the 32mm ""crusher driver"" is not as low as the Sony so sometimes it doesn't pick up the really low bass tones like in some trap music (future, migos) so I found that if I turned the slider down the larger main driver was able to pick them up instead. It wasn't brain crushing bass but was still heavy enough to be enjoyable. But other than that, I love these headphones. Came on time and nicely packed. I've since sold my sony's.",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
F. Wise,REALLY PUTS OUT HEAD-SHAKING BASS!!!,"WOW! This is real kick you in the head BASS! I'm 57 and love bass, sub-woofers,, etc. and never thought a headphone could really put out obvious bass - well this headphone does so very easily. The bass control is a nice little slider that goes from no extra bass added to an enormous amount. At max setting it's way too much for music that's already bass heavy but for older, less bass heavy music, this fills it in nicely. I actually laughed when I turned the bass up for the first time because I was not expecting my whole head to physically shake quite a bit. No, it can't shake the floor like a real room sub-woofer, but it does a very nice job of simulating that deep, ground-shaking bass a lot more than any other headphone I've ever tried. Well done and a keeper, unless of course, others have made similar headphones....",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Burleypacker,Den Totenkopf liebe ich!!!,"Bei dieser Rezension sitze ich mit diesen Kopfhrern am Rechner und muss jede Sekunde staunen, wie fantastisch der Sound ist. Bisher habe ich meine ""Home-Musik"" �ber mein Sennheiser RS165 System gehrt...was ich bis Dato echt geil fand. Nur leider beschr�nkt auf den Home-Gebrauch.Die SkullyCandy hat ein so krassen Sound, dass ich meine Sennheiser gleich versteigert habe.Der Kopfhrer sitzt perfekt �ber MEINE Ohrmuscheln...kein Dr�cken...auch nach 2h Gebrauch.Der Sound ist klar...bei Hhen wie Tiefen. Ich habe verschiedene Musikstiele ausprobiert...die Hhen klingen sehr klar und bei gesanglicher Interpretation ist alles sinnlich. Die Tiefen kommen satt r�ber und durch den BASS-REGLER, ist es mglich den Sound selbst zu variieren. Habe bei einem Bass geladenen Lied den Bass voll aufgedreht und musste staunen...KEIN Kratzen oder �berschallen der Tiefen...auch sonstige Ger�usche erstmal nicht erkennbar.Der Hrer und die eingebauten Membranen machen das mit.

The delivery was prompt, they felt comfortable on the head. The sound and bass beyond your wildest dreams. I won't lie to you this was a love story, sadly it did not end forever happy after.One day while getting ready to go work, I proceeded to pick up the headphones and place them upon my head and heard a crack, the images above display my horror. The quality of the plastic is too poor and sadly repeated daily usage had made it weak. I am completely heart broken, after 3 months only!

Tomskylicious,Better than Bose,"This is the best set of headphones I ever had - so much better than some bose ones I bought two years ago. I am someone who is a heavy podcast / radio listener more than music so can only comment on voice rather the layered intricacies of melody and harmony. They are comfortable and the noise-cancelling element (which is simply achieved - I think - through the external padding rather than any clever internal electronics) works well. The bluetooth is great but not a total panacea - if I am on the same floor it connects well to the source, if I go upstairs it works in the half of the house my stereo is in - but I do live in an old tall house with thick brick walls.

Al llevarlos en el cuello s� es algo incmodo pues los auriculares son bastante anchos por lo que s� llegan a estorbar a la hora de girar la cabeza o mirar hacia abajo.La bater�a es GENIAL, lo digo muy en serio, este era un punto que me preocupaba much�simo pero a veces siento que dura mucho ms de lo que dice, y claro var�a dependiendo del volumen y del nivel bajos que uses, entre ms alto, mayor consumo de bater�a pero realmente no creo que alguien pueda escuchar el mximo en ambos por mucho tiempo, y repito, la bater�a es genial, creo que me dura incluso casi dos semanas sin cargarlos ni una vez y los uso bastante.La carga es rapid�sima, no he tomado bien el tiempo pero debe ser aproximadamente unas dos horas.Algo que me parece sumamente �til es que sirvan con el auxiliar, claramente el volumen y bajos disminuyen en potencia pero me parece algo aceptable pues el cable me salva en viajes o trayectos y al conseguir dnde cargarlos vuelvo a usarlos sin el cable.El volumen es bueno, al no tener cancelacin de ruido a�n con el volumen al cien sigues percibiendo algunos ruidos del exterior, claro, no es mal volumen para el precio y caracter�sticas de estos aud�fonos.El bajo, en lo personal creo que es lo que ms llam mi atencin y no es para nada malo, no soy alguien experto en sonido pero como amante de la m�sica puedo decir que no son tan n�tidos a veces, muchas veces depende de la cancin que ests escuchando y la ecualizacin de tu dispositivo pero en general el sistema de bajos es bastante bueno en vol�menes moderados (y seguros), no el mejor pero como mencionaba, dudo mucho que alguien aguante escuchar los bajos al 100 durante mucho tiempo.Incluso ahora mismo los estoy utilizando con el volumen al m�nimo y los bajos al mximo y se escucha muy bien.En cuanto a resistencia no sabr�a decir algo concreto porque siempre intento tratarlos con mucho cuidado y no porque se sientan frgiles a primeras, sin embargo, debo mencionar que hay algunas piezas que se ve que al aplicarse una fuerza contraria a su movimiento podr�an romperse fcilmente pero a�n as� con 6 meses de uso y llevndolos de arriba a abajo no tienen ni un solo rayn.",4,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Puedes regular el bajeo y eso es excelente.Micrfono: He utilizado los aud�fonos para hacer llamadas y las personas con las que he hablado me dicen que me escuchan muy bien, aunque he escuchados audios que grabo con el micrfono y se escuchan bien pero no de la misma calidad como si los hubiera grabado con el micrfono del celular.Dise�o: En cuanto al dise�o a mi me encantan, considero que son de los mejores estticamente hablando.Bater�a: La duracin de la bater�a es impresionante, me dura aproximadamente dos semanas y lo utilizo todos los d�as.Portabilidad: Al ser plegables hace que sea mucho ms fcil transportarlos en tu mochila, sobretodo porque incluye la funda protectora.En conclusin, yo que no soy un audifilo, estoy muy satisfecho con la compra. �Lo recomiendo y no desesperen si al principio los sienten incmodos!",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Harry,"um, yeh theyre pretty good i guess","bought these for the bass, which holy shayte it has, this will RUMBLE YOUR BRAIN its that bassey. i like the design and fits well. is a bit tight on the ears but no problem, still comfortable for long periods. sound quality is also very good, what you expect for qquite expensive earphones. the carry case is just a bag, no real protection, wouldve loved a hard carry case. connection is mostly good, sometimes it will not connect and i have to restart process. bluetooth distance is about 10metres, can handle me walking about halfway across the gym before sound breaks up. the bass has an slider to set its basseyness, at 100percent bass, it ruins the music and gives a painfull ear ringing, i bought this cus i love strong bass, but i alsways have these at about 15percent bass as anything above destroys the experience. they handle sweat well, and do not fall off despite vigorous cycling. overall would recomend if you are quite wealthy and the money isnt much to you, but if you, like me, earn 5 pounds an hour, then maybe buy a differnet pair,i think these may be a tiny let down for the price off 90 quid, still, ive not returned them and am quite happy",4,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Mulls,$200 Ear Massage...,"First impression was nice. Opening the box and digging in was a nice experience. The included pouch was pretty decent and contained some room for storage of cables and such. The build quality of the unit itself was overall quite decent. It also clamped the head a touch too much. That's about where it ends for the good things.The sound quality was quite bad. Now I'm not the type of person that hates headphones that sound fun. I'm a bass head and I wanted bass! Turning them on and playing some EDM, rap and rock music was very different along each genre. EDM was by far the worst. The haptic driver seemed to rumble on kick drums and basses. It was very odd as it would switch from kickdrum to basses randomly. Also sometimes if the snares in a buildup were fast it would target them and when a drop with a fat 808 would come in it would not recognize it and stop rumbling all together leaving the horrible base sound of the headphones with the bass switch turned off. The high ends frankly hurt your ears. Vocals aren't present and no mid section is there almost at all. Very muddy and too sparkly.The best thing however was when a song had almost no high end and it would just hard rumble on your head. It felt like a massage around my ears...Rich bass is not found here. The best way to describe it would be to say it sounds very fake... I cannot recommend these to anyone...",2,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

MariosMarios,"Direi...""geniali""","Taglio cortose vorreste una qualita' audio come quella reale che si ascolta a un concerto dal vivo, se cercate un audio che (come dal vivo) vi dia sensazioni anche ""fisiche""..se avete idea di cosa sia il potente tuono che arriva dopo un fulmine a breve distanza...se non siete ""audiofili"" (queli che ascoltano e valutano e giudicano esclusivamente l'impianto audio usando ""7 brani di riferimento"" da decenni ma che di musica ci capiscono ben poco ) ..se siete solo dei semplici ""animali da concerto"" che hanno idea concreta di cosa voglia dire ascoltare musica reale dal vivo nei piu' svariati ambienti dotati di acustica molto differente, dovete prendere queste Skullcandy Crusher !Lo affermo senza avere alcun dubbio in merito, se non altro in quanto nella prima parte della mia vita sono stato musicista, critico musicale, fotografo (di musica live)..ho ascoltato Miles Davis dal vivo innumerevoli volte..ma anche Dizzy Gilespie, Sonny Rollins, Michael Brecker, Stan Getz, Wayne Shorter, Dexter Gordon, Chet Baker..McCoy Tyner, Ron Carter.. Weather Report con e senza Jaco Pastorius..e Petrucciani, Jarrett..Robert Plant, Jimmy Page..e Lou Reed, Daniel Lanois.. ma anche Norah Jones, Coldplay, John Mc Laughlin, Carmen McRae, Oasis, Calexico, Radiohead, The Who...ma anche Ivano Fossati, Giorgia.. talvolta non disdegnando anche la classica alla Scala. E dicendo questo voglio solo cercare di ""tagliare la testa al toro"", queste Skullcandy suonano benissimo e quando i toni bassi vanno in rilievo vibrano, si muovono, tremano.In definitiva, quel che manca nell'ascolto in cuffia e' sempre una parte essenziale della musica,ovvero l'impatto sonoro, le vibrazioni (anche fisiche), la dinamica (che non puo' prescindere da un pieno orchestrale che ""sposta l'aria"" durante l'esecuzione di una sinfonia di ""Ludovico Van""  ad opera, talvolta, di 100 e oltre musicisti e relativi strumenti)Non sono cuffie per ascoltatori a caccia di ""campanellini e sfumature sublimi""... che considero ""hobbisti che scrivono per hobbisti"", sono cuffie per musicisti e non per ascoltatori di impianti audio ;)Ogni concerto dal vivo, sembrerebbe inutile a dirsi ma non lo e' affatto!, offre una timbrica differente perche' cambia l'ambiente, a partire dalla sua ampiezza...Tamburellando con le dita sull'archetto di queste cuffie, si nota immediatamente che viene prodotto un consistente effetto ""tamburo"" e, credo, sia questo ""l'ingrediente segreto"" in grado di creare le sensazioni psicoacustichePeccato che il padiglione imbottito sia stato calcolato probabilmente basandosi sulla popolazione orientale, perche' e' troppo piccolo e anche se morbido e ben imbottito, dopo non molto tempo le orecchie fanno male.Sempre a proposito delle imbottiture, ho provato a vadere se fossero sostituibili e purtroppo mi sono trovato in mano l'imbottitura destra, che si e' sfilata abbastanza facilmente. Assurdo, e' tenuta in sede da una ""plastichina"" semi rigida  con alcuni intagli sulla circoferenza e trattenuta da una guida/binario fin troppo abbondante (ma non e' facile rimettere in sede il padiglione imbottito, tanto che per riuscirci ho perso almeno 30 minuti, fremendo, in quanto volevo provare di nuovo quelle sensazioni ma era evidente che il sistema di fissaggio e' estremamente precario e delicato, quindi destinato a durare poco )Le acquisterei di nuovo ? Senza dubbio SI!Tanto che sto gia' cercando le occasioni giuste per acquistarne altri esemplari da tenere come rimpiazzo per il futuro, l'idea di doverne fare, prima poi a meno non mi piace.Aggiornamento - 10 mesi dopo (26/10/2020)Purtroppo la plastica con cui sono costruite � inaccettabile, scadente, si sbriciola.Ma hanno anche fatto di peggio, non solo la plastica si sbriciola, ma � stata usata anche per realizzare il meccanismo che, oltre a trattenere i padiglioni,  ne rende possibile il movimento e la piegatura(guardate tra le foto ufficiali qui sopra, in una di queste sono piegate)Un paio di giorni fa stavo per ascoltare della musica, come faccio ogni sera, cos� prendo le cuffie le metto in testa e le accendo... faccio partire la musica, quando nel giro di alcuni secondi ecco che le cuffie cadono sul divano sul quale ero seduto! Guardo e... uno dei padiglioni � staccato, guardo meglio e mi rendo conto che si sono sbriciolate due piccole asole a ""clip"". Fatte cos�, presumo, per poter inserire/incastrare  (in fabbrica) con una leggera pressione i padiglioni, asole ricavate direttamente nello stampo della plastica e dentro le quali si muovono, pazzesco, due piccoli ""cilindretti"" per ciascun padiglione e realizzati usando sempre lo stampo della plastica.Guardare le dimensioni minime di asoline e ""cilindretti"" e il fatto che quello che dovrebbe essere un ""meccanismo""  cruciale e molto sollecitato sia stato ricavato dallo stampo della plastica,  � stato sufficiente a capire che quando le cuffie sono uscite dalla fabbrica avevano gi� le ore contate!Incredibile! Cercando informazioni e casi analoghi, ho trovato anche qui recensioni (non italiane) nelle quali si lamentano del fatto che la plastica si sbriciola e che l'assistenza ha semplicemente ignorato le loro richieste, ho trovato anche alcuni video nei quali si parla di Skullcandy HESH 3 ""a scadenza"" in quanto la plastica si spacca dopo pochi mesi (parla di 6 mesi, quindi sono stato anche fortunato) e di Skullcandy Crusher riparate alla buona usando della plastica ""liquida"" bicomponente.Credo che il produttore non legger� mai mai queste note, ma spero che si siano resi conto del problema e che in seguito abbiano provveduto a risolverlo realizzando un sistema solido!",5,B01DWH7AIM,Colour: Gray/Tan,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
DJ Valentino,BOOM FREAKING BOOM!!! BEST HEADPHONES EVER!!!,"These headphones are AWESOME! The bass slider is awesome for listening to different kinds of music. When you want bass though you can turn it up and your head will feel like you are sitting in a geo metro with 6 12 inch subs running 15,000 watts with the windows up. The frequencies that seem to hit the hardest are between 60 and 45 Hz. I listen to literally everything from Frank Sinatra to Metallica to Eazy-E, Ti�sto, Datsik, The Weeknd, The Beach Boys, Johnny Cash & Willie Nelson. Noise canceling is FANTASTIC. I am a groomer and work with loud jet dryers and barking dogs all day and when my headphones are on I don't hear anything but what I'm listening to. I am writing this review at Bingo night at my favorite bar in Seattle and the only time I can hear screaming or announcements is when my computer goes to the next song. Bluetooth functionality is great on everything except my iPhone but that doesn't count because my phone is suffering from skin cancer and survived being drowned. I like that there is also the option for an aux cable to be attached in case you have a terminally ill phone like me. Battery life is insane for a pair of headphones. I haven't had them die on me yet and I charge them in vain twice a week and listen to them incessantly 5 days a week for 8+ hours a day on full blast. Which brings me to comfort level; you don't even know they are on your head aside from the fact that there are front stage seats to Woodstock in each ear. Nice job Skull Candy. Not even Dr. Dre could make something this good and his headphones are almost double the price if not more. I have been an avid Bose and Sennheisser user for as long as I can remember, until now...",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Donna Whitney,"$130 Yes, $200 Eh.","Great product, especially for Bass lovers. The crusher seals out noise pretty well it does leak noise but only at higher levels when you crank the headphones. They tend to get pretty warm, they where a tight fit at first but once having them on for 24 hours they feel much better. The audio range on Skulls aren't bad but it's noticeable When I through my gaming headphones on I can instantly tell they're lacking BUT for what I paid for em they're great for the range. You can wear them to thee gym with no problems after I'm done tho I wipe em down. One problem I do have with the candy is going back a song since you have to hold the minus button for so long I'm unable to go backwards maybe I can set something but haven't figured it out if I can. The range on the Bluetooth is also lacking I can't go far until it starts acting up but I do see other people saying they're able to walk a good distance before it starts cutting out but not for me. Battery life is quite insane haven't fully tested it but it goes for some time. So, overall I wouldn't spend 200 on these unless I'm a Bass freak, but 130 is a awesome price for the crushers.",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Mike W.,Wonderful buy,"These head phones are everything I was hoping for. They are comfortable and have great sound quality. Well made, and built to last. They fit around my ears comfortably with no weird overlap. First off, the packaging is lovely. The box is magnetic close. Open it and there's two small boxes, one containing the charging cable (around 2ft length) and the aux cord with mic for wired use. The second box is a detailed instruction book, and a quick use guide. Next is the headphones in the carry case. Unfortunately it's not a hard case, more of a small draw string. With that said, the case is still useful under the fact that it has a plush inside to keep the headphones from getting scratched, but also has two small pockets inside to hold the aux cable and charger. Now for the actual headphones. I love the way they fit around my head, they are secure enough to not fall off, yet not constricting. The sound quality is equal to that of beats but obviously what really set these apart is the bass. It really is bass you can feel. They physically vibrate making the experience perfect for bass lovers. But for those that don't always want that it's easy enough to turn down with a slider on the side. All around I'd give these an 8/10",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Moriarty,Super sound for a great price,"Swapped my Koss for the Skullcandy Crusher headset. No comparison. Skullcandy Crusher is even better than my Bose external speakers I have hooked up to my Mac. This headset picks up subtle sounds and still delivers great bass, which is adjustable. The adjustment feature and folding capabilities are awesome. I can store the headset and connectors in my Headcase Audio hard case I got from RonsElectronics.com. Everything, and I do mean everything, fits in the case. I travel all across the USA. You don't always have access to charge your devices. I charged fully before leaving home. I still haven't recharged after five weeks of periodic use which is several hours at a time. They are a full over the ear. That helps reduce the noise when in a noisy environment. I have not tried using during a phone call, however I am confident in their performance based on everything else they have done. Big bang for your buck if you want a high end sound for a reasonable price.",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Fabio,Grande delusione.,"Sulla scia delle tante recensioni positive lette ho deciso di prendere questa cuffia. Premetto che ascolto principalmente rock che amo i bassi potenti e che ascolto tanta musica in cuffie (per non farmi cacciare di casa). Non sono un audiofilo e non sono in grado di fare recensioni parlando di risposta in frquenza di palcoscenico o altre argomentazioni tecniche, per� ascolto tanta musica e posseggo diverse cuffie quindi vi dar� un parere spassionato basato sulla mia esperienza. NON comprate questa cuffia. Quello che viene spacciato come  ""bassi"" � solo una pressione meccanica esercitata dalla cuffia sulle orecchie dovuta ad un meccanismo a lamella che si trova all'interno e che vibra a ritmo di musica. Peccato ch� tale meccanismo distrugge completamente non solo i bassi ma tutte le frequenze. La musica diventa rumore. Gli alti sono assenti, nessuna brillantezza, i medi completamente impastati, i bassi semplicemente un disastro. L'ascolto diventa fastidioso spiacevole, davvero una brutta esperienza. Non so dirvi se il mio esemplare sia difettoso o meno perch� altrimenti non spiego assolutamente tutte le recensioni positive. Queste cuffie sono davvero pessime. Shennaiser di pari prezzo sono 10 volte superiori anche sui bassi. Le mie hd 569 annientano queste skull candy anche sui bassi. Le 599 poi (spendendo la stessa cifra) le polverizzano del tutto. Le ho ascoltate e riascoltate per parecchie ore perch� non potevo pensare che tanta gente le abbia trovate straordinarie ed io nemmeno sufficienti. Ma proprio non riesco a darmi una ragione. Forse ormai ascoltano tutti musica dal telefono e magari in mp3 e allora questa specie di ""bassi"" possono sembrare potenti. Alla fine ho decretato di aver buttato via dei soldi. Queste cuffie valgono al massimo una cinquantina di euro e non di pi�. Le metter� da parte. Io amo sentire musica non rumori gonfiati. Fine.",1,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Arnaud C,"L'couter, c'est l'adopter !","On ne va pas y aller par 4 chemins, j'ai pris une p***** de claque!Amateur d'lectro, mais pas seulement, mon choix s'est arr�t sur ce Crusher Wireless apr�s pas mal de recherches concernant des casques ""basseux"". Je l'ai command un peu � l'aveugle, sachant que je ne l'ai pas trouv dans le commerce pour le tester auparavant, j'ai donc fait confiance � tous les tests que j'ai pu lire sur ce casque (dont certains taient plut�t ngatifs d'ailleurs ). Apr�s 2 semaines d'utilisation, je peux vous dire que je ne regrette absolument pas mon achat. Les audiophiles de la vieille cole vous diront peut-�tre que ce casque c'est du bullshit, que ces retours vibratoires ne sont qu'un argument marketing, qu'ils dnaturent le son...Pour moi, avant tout, musique= motion! Et bien ce casque en dlivre une bonne grosse dose d'motion. Des basses dmentielles, profondes, qui donnent une nouvelle dimension � l'coute. Des mdiums et aigus qui ne sont pas en reste et qui ne se laissent pas touffer par le bas du spectre. Une tr�s bonne spatialisation et un niveau sonore lev. Le casque ne s’essouffle jamais, et tant donn la puissance dlivre , ses 40 heures d'autonomie sont surprenantes!Pour moi ce casque peut s'adapter � tous les styles de musique, je prends autant de plaisir � couter du ""boum boum"" que du classique! Posez-vous sur votre canap, lancez un bon vieux Requiem de Wagner, poussez le curseur des basses, fermez les yeux, et chaque coup de tambour vous semblera provenir d'outre-tombe !Le niveau des basses est toutefois � rgler avec parcimonie, suivant le mastering de chaque titre. Je ne dpasse quasiment pas les 30%, le casque est dj� tr�s bon sans les retours haptiques.Donc si comme moi vous n'arrivez pas � vous dcider dans l'achat d'un casque, que vous aimez les basses puissantes, profondes, que vous aimez l'impact qu'un sub peut vous procurer, sans pour autant oublier le haut du spectre, alors ne cherchez pas plus loin, c'est le produit qu'il vous faut !LES POINTS NEGATIFS :- Les retours haptiques rsonnent lorsque l'on marche et que le casque est teint ou � faible niveau, je le dconseille pour une utilisation nomade.- Le casque peut occasionner une petite g�ne lors de longues coutes.LES POINTS POSITIFS- Des basses indescriptibles !- Des mdiums et aigus clairs et prcis- un excellent rapport qualit/prix !",5,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Astronaut,Boom Boom Boom Boom.,"I mean for under 10,000. A perfect pair of headphones for your music, movie, games needs. I usually use them for listening to music while commuting or playing games in my free hour, And before this I owned a pair of AKG headphones. While playing the games especially when I shoot bullets or bombs in PUBG, or Battlefield you can feel the blasts around you there's no more shreiking noise that force you to put volume low instead there's a bham-bham bullet echo with brilliant bass.For music I can tell, if you really wanna test. Listen to Get low ( DJ snake ). I mean you ok understand after that demonstration of bass power these little orbs posses.Build is fantastic not cheap plastic but very premium plastic and well I don't like the word plastic anyway for headphones but I feel that the slider in the headphone just made me drool over the design. It's so smooth that you feel like real proud for owning them and can't wait for people to ask  how are these. You just slid them your pair and let them judge for themselves. Only real bite to the eyes are the wires are outside but it can be overlooked coz after 40 Hrs of battery life I don't think you would bother looking at the wire. I mean you can't stand in front of mirror for 40hrs and try to judge them by the wires xD.Noise cancellation. Ummm only passive no real dedicated deal to give you noise cancellation but if you ask me that bass won't let you hear the noise anyway. With all the bhooooom in your years. Nope very less chance for the noise to penetrate that.Although there are few things that makes me come forward with it that is the sound leaks from the headphones quite more than slightly so if you planning to watch porn with the blasting volume I mind, you keep it low otherwise people around you might just feel free to the sound.Oh yeah I returned my first batch coz of some problem in the slider but the next batch of headphones came from one month prior batch. And I felt there that there was more distortion in the first pair of headphones and in the next pair there was no distortion if I slide the bass all the way up.

lattimer,I love crisp highs,"Ok, I am a audio fanatic and I invest in hi-end headphones as well as headphones as cheap as $20. I have Mr.speakers over ear headphones which cost me $1000, I also own beyerdynamic t1, which also cost me $1000, Audeze sine, Sony wh1000’s, bloodio’s ufo”s etc. I love crisp highs, full mids and of course deep bass. My high end headphones are the best for my money because the clarity, depth and neutrality is what I pay for most. This is why I’ll never own a pair beats headphones because they’re garbage. Now let’s get to the skullcandy crusher wireless headphones. Just awesome, that’s why I gave them 5 stars. The build of the headphones are of high quality plastic that doesn’t fit too tight and looks great on your head.  Now the best part....the sound. The highs are nice but can be a little more sharper, the mids could be a little more forward but sounds good and of course, that bass. Hmmm, yes, the skullcandy crushers have the best bass in headphone history. Very deep yet not overpowering the highs and mids....unless you want them to. They are like literally wearing a subwoofer on your head....totally amazing to hear!! You can adjust the bass with the slider on the side of the headphone to low or earthshaking!!! Now if these headphones sound great for all genres of music, they really really shine while watching movies!! You have to hear them for yourself to believe it. When fully charged you get 40 hours of Bluetooth play, that’s more than any other Bluetooth, and if they’re not charged, the incredible bass plays exactly the same wired, amazing!!! The cost of these headphones are $150 to $200. I would have payed $500 plus for these cans. Buy them quickly before skullcandy figures it out and raises the prices. Are they my favorite headphones...no. Are they the most fun you’re going to get from any headphone....definitely!!! I highly recommend these headphones for every day use and you don’t need an amplifier, they’ll play on any device. I’m gonna buy another pair for no damn reason, lol.

Rodrigo Alvarez,Buen dise�o pero podr�an ser mejores por el precio que uno paga,"El dise�o es lo que uno espera, y parecen robustos. Lo de los bajos es interesante pero exigen un audio de muy buena calidad sino se escucha medio feo. El gran problema es que la conexin bluetooth no es tan slida como uno creer�a para un auricular de estos valores. Cada tanto se corta, y me refiero teniendo el telfono cerca. A�n as�, por el momento estoy contento y conforme con el producto pero podr�an ser un poco ms econmicos (ms teniendo en cuenta que no tienen noise cancelling).Un dato de color sobre el subwoofer incorporado: cualquier vibracin externa, o el golpe de los pasos al caminar, retumba y se puede volver bastante molesto.",3,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Noticed they was expecting me to pay postage?!?!?  I e-mailed them to confirm this and they said ""Yes I have to pay postage to return""  their faulty headphones.

Siddharth Meloth,)Build quality - great looks and built to last,"Was quite confused regarding skull candy crushers and Sennheiser, but based on other reviews choosed the skull candy. Let’s me summarise based on my usage for about 2 weeks :1.)Build quality - great looks and built to last .2.)Battery life - with daily usage of about 2-3 hours will easily last upto a week.3.) Comfort - excellent cushioning can easily wear for hours together.And last and the most important one4.) Sound - if u r looking for bass look no further this things eats even Sony for breakfast ! Dial the slider to max settings and literally can make ur head vibrate !!",4,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
AmanAman,Poor build quality (broke within 6 months),"To start off, it sounds good and probably has the most bass compared to the other headphones but you're not going to use the full bass for more than 5 minutes, no matter how much of a bass-head you are, your head is going to hurt.The bass level you're going to use is around 30%, which is something you would get from any good headphone in this price range and that is what you should do.PROS:- Good sound quality- Has ""too much"" bass, you'd love it for the first 5 minutes and that's about it.- Battery backup is good enoughCONS:- POOR build quality: Even a 1-2k headphone is more 'solid'. This is the second Skullcandy headphone I purchased and I am convinced that the brand doesn't really care about the quality. My headphones broke within 6 months (The right side literally hangs from the wire)- Winter use only, can't use for long durations in summers.- Can't think of other cons since first one above should be enough to convince you to not buy it.Fun fact: It has cracked 4 times, for the first 3 cracks I used super glue but this last one can't be fixed.",1,B01DWH77GC,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Madeleine Pomeroy,I no longer recommend Skull Candy headphones,"I would like to start off by saying that I am missing 75% of my hearing. Without headphones, I can't hear my phone very well, so hence I always have a pair. Well, during the current events, my headphones broke. I absolutely dreaded ordering a pair online, as most quality headphones are extremely expensive, and as a broke college student, that just wasn't an option. Then I found these Skull Candy Cassette headphones. Originally I was going to wait a week to write a review, but these are genuinely life changing. Instead of barely being loud enough to listen to my calls and videos at 100%, I am comfortably enjoying them at 25%. And the battery life is really great. I received these headphones on Sunday, charged them that night, and am writing this on Tuesday, as of which I have been constantly using them these past two days and they are at 80%. As a whole, if you want quality, affordable headphones, get these. I can't recommend them enough. I will never buy another pair of headphones and once my job starts up again, I would love to buy them in other colours. 10/10. Amazing product, absolutely buy these headphones.EDIT: It's been a few months. I have been very careful with these headphones, and despite that, they are now all cracked up and busted. Let me state: I do not throw these. I don't even handle them roughly. The worst I have ever done is wear them around my neck, and they are absolutely shattered. I would no longer recommend this product.",2,B07VT1Z7DV,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

However, the mic on these are terrible and the sound keeps glitching. If I use the mic via bluetooth it sounds extremely glitched and computerized. If I use the mic using the aux cable, then the audio only goes into one headphone and you sound like you're 1000 miles away (but the quality is good!!). If I try to listen to anything (Spotify, YouTube, Netflix), the audio randomly starts glitching and becoming computerized, and the only thing that fixes it is disconnecting and reconnecting the headphones.

So that alone is at least 4 stars in my book.  I got them for my 8 and 10 year olds and they fit perfectly.  They are very light weight, and the battery lasts quite long.

Tones are good. Bass is not very high but enough for a normal listener. If you are a bass lover, then that's some drop for you.4. Sound quality is more better with the aux connected as is the case with all other wireless headphones4. Charging 10 min give upto 1hr 30min of listening time. Good for taking and making callsCons: 1. I think the audio volume is not great. You can't hear it loud enough till you increase it to more than 70%2. No noise cancellation but upto 60% of the noise is impeded by the on ear cushions.

Arkten Arachlassair,Best headphones I've ever had,"First of all, a bit about me that's relevant. Idk if I'd call myself an audiophile per say, but, my range of hearing is fine to the level of better than most musicians.Nothing messes with me more than when I have a cheap pair of headphones which interfere with what I'm listening to.... If their cheap and they distort the sound, or, are insane with treble so as to be piercing, I'll notice and it'll probably be painful to my ears. Most of the audio ranges I hear are at the - 10 range, meaning, almost perfect hearing.That means, even on a $20 set of headphones, I'll probably use them because of necessity, but hate the experience because of how much they interfere with my experience since I can tell if there's a quality issue even at a very fine degree, I'll find it and it'll bug me, and, given that I have headphones on most of they day and listen to things frequently, it's important that I buy quality headphones.So, I'm no stranger to Skull Candy. Their audio quality is the best of all the headphones I've had over the decades. The issue which always has me hesitant to buy them is a matter of durability.Most of my less expensive Skullcandy headphones have broken very easily, which sucked when I was on the go... It was to the point which I was hesitant to buy these headphones because of similar fears and the price...That said, these headphones were an investment, and and investment that panned out.I've been using the Crusher Evo headphones for more than a year now, constantly, daily, most of the day and even when sleeping, so, this review is based on almost 24/7 usage for more than a year... And...They're still working amazing, the battery life is still phenomenal, the advertising that states they're able to play for hours on a charge of only a few minutes is absolutely true too. I've accidentally stepped on them, I've slept with them on most nights, and nothing has happened except that, after such heavy usage, today one of the earpads got a tear around the edge that tucks under the plastic of the headphones which... Thankfully, they sell replacements for the foam.The product is sturdy, has a very nice feel, solid, durable weight and plastic, the foam wraps around the ears nicely, and I can easily get a proper, snug fit every time which, I have a big-ish head and long-ish ears, so, that's not something that's easy for me usually.Not only are they extremely comfortable and scream quality from their physical aspects, but it came with a rugged carrying bag and nice aux chord, and extremely high quality long charging cable. It didn't come with a charging brick, but has worked with all the charging bricks I've used on them, including my Nintendo Switch charger.Now, all that's fine... Being the most durable and comfortable feeling headphones is important... But, headphones can feel amazing, but have Crap sound quality so, that's the aspect I love the most about these... That sound quality.... One word... Amazing...So, everything sounds accurate, there's no distortion and, even having been playing things at max volume for a year straight, there's still no distortion and everything sounds just as amazing as they used to. One of the aspects I love is the bass...That's another thing I need to be spot on with headphones, bass. They could be clear, have accurate sound and everything, but of there is no bass, or the bass is very weak, I physically can't use the headphones... That's how important bass is to me... Furthermore, accurate bass is a necessity. Idk how many pairs of headphones I ended up chucking into the bin because, yeah, they had powerful bass, but that bass wasn't accurate, and that bass lead to the rest of the sounds being obscured/distorted/sounding like someone is talking normally right next to a sub-woofer.These headphones play the bass loud, accurate, and do so without compromising the quality of the rest of the audio... And... Holy gods.... I was startled to the point the headphones flew off my ears by how powerful the bass is when you adjust the slider on them to max bass boost... Why? They vibrated intensely. Not in a bad way, as in, when you have them on and the bass hits and vibrates the speakers, you won't be bothered by it/it won't cause an unpleasant feeling, but it is there and.... Idk... I find I like it because it's a part of the engineering of the headphones and not an unintended result.That said, these are, by far, the best audi investment I've ever made. I have used them constantly for a full year extremely heavily, and they're still here and working just the same. By contrast, previously, I'd have gone through 5/6 pairs of other headphones by Now, so.... If you can afford these, get them.They are technically a headset unit, and actually prefer to take calls with them, but, I can't tell you if the microphone quality is the best, just that I haven't had any complaints from anyone, so, given that even with the best microphone on prior headsets, I got complaints, I'd imagine that is also good with these headphones because, I have never gotten a complaint or someone saying ""You're breaking up. What did you say?"".These will be used when I get back to mixing tracks and making music when I fix my computer, that's how good they are.Tl;Dr - Worth it.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Zachariah,"I've tried the ""Best"" and these are clearly superior!","I've purchased Sony's and Bose's top of the line headsets which are decent. Sony's lack of physical buttons make them practically unusable but Bose and Sony are very similar when it comes to overall sound. However, nothing for under 2k comes close to these. The most impressive sound and base I've ever experienced in a product that doesn't cost many thousands of dollars. FYI: I have some hearing damage from military service and if you're hearing is not great you will truly appreciate the extra volume these headphones provide. Truly amazing.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Dr. DMTDr. DMT,Dedicated Subwoofer complete the system,"You have your own dedicated subwoofer. And you know the importance of of a subwoofer in a sound system  It makes the biggest difference!Now you can ramped the subwoofer without hesitation, without consideration to your family or your whole community or other cars besides you, because now your the only one experiencing it. For $199 you got yourself a home theater system or a club sound system. Do not the worry the mids and high are still there. I��m listening to wedding guitar classics now  and I��m telling you the subwoofer part just adds dimension. No ANC it means no dizziness and nausea. Headache might still be there if you over do the bass slider. But the bass slider is just fun. It does not muddy other sounds. The equalizer are music, movie, or podcast. And the best is movie even for music.  Good God I return the Sony xm4,  bose QC2 and gave my beats studio3 to my son. So I have the status BT one for like audiophile listening also my fav. I bought the crusher evo together with the old Skullcandy Grind wireless and is another fav.  The grind is comparable to have a studio bookshelf speaker with out sub. The bass still there and still loud but not like the evo. I like the grind because it sound like it��s open back although not and with out the leak . It��s on ear and it is very light and convenient.  This Evo I dare to say is way better than Sony xm4 and bose QC2.I don��t think this is just for bass heads . Probably the old versions- wireless and the ANC, but not this one. The bass slider just complete the system. You know those purist who did not experience subwoofers and when they have it they are just amaze with what they were hearing and what they were missing. It��s comparable to this. Just buy it.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
SimonSimon,Must have for bass lover but problem with hissing sound when wired and turn on for Black Evos,"Love the product that i ordered another one.Must have for bass lovers.*Updated 25 Sept 2020*Background & TestingSo I bought 2 Evos (black and grey) and noticed both have the hissing sound when I plug it in.The hissing sound is gone when I turn off the headphones while they are still plugged in but it will mean I will lose the sensory bass functionality.On a volume level from 1-10, I can hear a clear hissing sound from my black evo at a level of 4 while my grey evo is producing the hissing sound at a level of 1 or below(so it is still bearable).I had tested this with 6 different audio cables(including 2 cables that comes with the boxes) and the result is the same for all the cables and different devices.I even tested both headphones in an area of my house which doesn't have any electrical audio interference to make sure.I have seen a fellow customer's review from Germany having the same problem in the customer reviews so I not sure whether the bug is happening only for some units or all.I have contacted Amazon CS and now in talks with Skullcandy directly to resolve the problem.I love the headphones but the hissing sound when plugged in with no sound is driving me nuts.*Aftercare support update*So Skullcandy was nice to let me do a local warranty exchange with their local distributor.When I went down to do the 1 on 1 exchange. The CS person tested it out the issue and found out their black demo set was having the same issue. I requested to exchange for a grey one since my other grey evo was ok.Turns out it is working fine.I think there might be some qc issue with the first batch of black Evos which some customers had experienced with the hissing sound when wired.I still love the headphones now even more since there isn't any more hissing sound :)",4,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Amazon Customer,Entitled Bass,"Imagine you had $1000 to put a band together. You needed to hire bass, mids and highs (not how it works but bear with me).You decide to give $700 to bass and cut the remaining $300 to mid and high equally, giving them $150 each. The band performs and as the songs builds up it sounds pretty alright. Then when bass goes off, it's so stupidly good, it makes the other two look childish in comparison. Kinda like hiring Mariah Carey to do vocals for a High School band.Don't get me wrong, if you love bass, and I mean LOVE bass, you'll love these cans. But my god, it is so bass focused that it has a dedicated bass slider for the intensity. That, should tell you enough.These are my first and last pair of skullcandy crushers. They aren't bad by any means. I just wish that the same amount of love and attention were given to the other 67% of the audio spectrum, because while mids and highs don't sound bad, hell I'd even call them good, the bass is so overwhelmingly amazing that they seem bad by comparison.",3,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
keaston,Sounds great with all types of music!,"These are my first Crusher headphones, and wow. I'm blown away! If you're a basshead who likes a bunch of different music genres, you'll love these. Rock, metal, classical, indie, jazz, country, ambient, oldies, you name it. The bass isn't muddy and overpowering in genres that typically aren't bass heavy.The mids and highs are very clear, and even more so with the personalized setting in the Skullcandy app.The haptic bass can be adjusted to a comfortable level that can be listened to every day for many songs, without having to adjust it for every song. For me, the sweet spot is on the lower end of the slider.The bass is punchy with the added vibration from the haptic feedback. On the lower end, it's a very smooth and subtle rumble that enhances your listening experience.But if you want to go wild and have your own personal concert, you can max the bass out and feel it rattle your ears.The common description of being up close to a big stereo speaker is a pretty good comparison, it's a very unique experience.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Kennedy GrimKennedy Grim,Be prepared to use the warranty,"I had high hopes for these headphones mostly due to the amount of money I spent on them and the purposed 40+ hour play time, I had them for little over a month and rarely used them when it finally came time to charge them, it plugged them in for four hours and the little red light lit up indicating it was charging, I come back four hours later and they are entirely shut down, won��t turn on, won��t connect to the app and won��t even show that it is charging when plugged back in. Apparently you can��t have them plugged in for more then two hours before they just stop working, I am outraged they would charge more then $90 dollars on a set of headphones that will break that easily, then have the audacity to charge me shipping fees to get these brand new headphones fixed, especially due to an issue that isn��t even warned about and could so commonly happen, very disappointed.",1,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Kristen W,Best Budget Headphones (only review you need),"I will get the cons out of the way first but keep reading. (I��m writing from my moms account)First of all I have to exchange my pair because one headphone doesn��t stay unfolded. It doesn��t snap and wants to fold when held at an angle. I don��t believe this is my fault but don��t make this the reason not to buy these headphones. They��re amazing.The sound leaks but very little. If you��re in a dead silent area people will hear your music slightly. I recommend 60 percent volume if you don��t want your music to be obvious to anyone in a library or car. If you��re at the gym you can crank your music to 70-80 percent and you will be fine. If you��re on a walk alone or running, etc you can test your ear drums with max volume.Not noise canceling. Sound will be muffled but with your music on these are noise cancelling. My mom has yelled at me and I couldn��t hear her one bit.These are definitely not convenient for every situation because of slight sound leakage and lack of noise cancellation, along with a bad mic like all wireless headphones.On a positive note you can adjust the bass according to your mood and have very good sound and they are also really good for video games because of the 8D sound or whatever it��s called. Battery life seems to be infinite but when you want to you can plug them in to your PC, power bank, wall outlet, etc and after 10 minutes you have a few hours of battery life.They don��t feel cheap and they fold in various ways and come with a nice bag and a cool box I will keep.So in conclusion these are high quality budget headphones that are for you intense music genre listeners. If you listen to more mellow music you can find noise canceling headphones for this price range like the sound space q45s but I can��t speak for the sound quality because I don��t own them yet.Have a blessed day and thanks for reading this.-Your over the top 14 year old review writer,Elijah",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
KikemotionsKikemotions,Un digno sucesor...,"Quise hacer esta rese�a compar�ndolo con el modelo Original, Crusher Wireless, ya que lo tengo desde hace 3 a�os y eran mis aud�fonos favoritos hasta ahora.Comenzar diciendo que escuchar m�sica en unos aud�fonos como estos es m�s que solo el sonido y se vuelve una experiencia divertida. Cada cambio de cancin es una sorpresa al ver como el bajo haptico convierte una buena cancin en una rumba.Me encanta la m�sica y tengo varios aud�fonos de distintas clases, On ear, Over Ear, In Ear, de Conduccin Osea, y Neckbands. He pasado por JBL S400BT, Samsung U Pro, 1 More Double driver ANC Pro, Aftershokz Trekz Air, Nura entre otros , pero adem�s he podido probar Bos QC35 y los Sony's WH-x1000M3.Comparado con Sony y Bos, estos aud�fonos son distintos pero de buena manera. Quiz�s no tengan la apertura, el brillo y la calidad de esos modelos, pero depende los gneros que escuches, puede llegar a ser una experiencia superior.Cmo tuve unos Crusher Wireless OG quiero compararlos con esos, y la principal diferencia est� en la manera en que manejan el bajo. Los Crusher Wireless suenan como si tuvieses un bajo dentro del ba�l/cajuela del carro, con un sonido potente pero plano que se siente porque pone a vibrar todo el carro, pero es boomy y hay canciones donde la frecuencia de bajo no la coge y la m�sica suena como si tuvieras en nivel de bajo apagado, a excepcin de uno que otro momento. Hasta ahora pens que eran los aud�fonos con mejor bajo que hab�a podido probar seguidos de los Sony BT950XB y los JBL S400BT, pero despus de escuchar el poder de los Crusher Evo, es otra dimensin.Este bajo siente como bajo de Sub Woofer o de uno de los JBL Boombox, con bajos profundos que retumban y hacen que se multiplique el poder del bajo.Para ponerlo en palabras onomatopeyicas, el bajo de los CW suena Boooooooooooooommm plano mientras que los CE suenan Booo wooo wooo wooo y sientes cuando el bajo haptico va hacia adelante y hacia atr�s.Con el nivel de bajo apagado, los aud�fonos son decentes, con una buena amplitud/soundstage y separacin de instrumentos. Son brillantes, pero no tan brillantes como los CW, sino m�s bien un poco tibios, sin dejar de sonar muy bien en altos y medios.La opcin de usar la App es muy buena, porque permite personalizar el sonido de los aud�fonos seg�n nuestra respuesta a una serie de sonidos que vamos descartando. Aparte, tiene modo para podcast y otro para pel�culas y todos funcionan muy bien.En la parte f�sica, me gusta la calidad de los materiales; se sienten m�s premium que los CW, y mucho m�s robustos. El peso es similarz aunque la fuerza de la diadema esmayor en los CW, haciendo que estos sean mucho m�s cmodos. Pero a�n as�, requieren de una ajustada cada hora m�s o menos para evitar la fatiga de la oreja. (En mi caso, ya que soy de cara ancha)De los CW originales extra�o los botones, que son m�s grandes y de mejor dise�o + o - en vez de 3 botones.Prob tambin los Crusher ANC y suenan muy similar, pero el ANC no es tan bueno as� que no vale la pena pagar de m�s.+ El poder del bajo+ los materiales de construccin+ La horma de la diadema es m�s cerrada y sobresalen menos por los lados.+ Estos usan codecs SBC y AAC, por lo que funcionan bien para Apple y Android. (Aunque a m� me gusta m�s el sonido en SBC, porque tiene mayor ganancia y el bajo pega m�s duro.)+ Los colores en los que vienen+ El precio+ El material de los pads es muy bueno+ El sonido es muy bueno y el bajo no ahoga medios y altos.+ Mejor respuesta a frecuencias bajas.- El aislamiento pasivo es mejor en los CW. Estos dejan que entrar mucho ruido externo a bajo volumen. Aunque apenas subes ya no escuchas nada m�s. �- Sigue viniendo con un Pouch(estuche suave) que aunque es pr�ctico si los llevas adentro del malet�n, para colgarlos por fuera con una carabina es mejor un estuche r�gido.- No se pueden conectar a 2 dispositivos al tiempo como los CW originales.- No se puede usar el Bajo Haptico con la conexin por cable cuando est�n descargados como en los CW.+ O - No he podido probar, pero los CW tra�an un micrfono en el cable que permit�a usarlos de manos libres con la conexin por cable, estos no traen micrfono en linea, pero por los plugs, parece que usan el micrfono de los mismos aud�fonos. Cuando pruebe, actualizo la rese�a.",5,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Azaad Kukha-Bryson,Bass is artificial,"It wasn��t bad at all, but I guess I should have done a bit more research.  I read about the mind blasting bass and wanted to try it out for myself - I love bass.  It was described as having �bass you can feel�� and bass that can rattle your skull.  Well it does rattle your skull but it��s because there are haptic feedback drivers built in that literally vibrate your head along to the beat. The head shaking doesn��t really come from the sound but a clever trick that makes it seem like the bass is rattling the cans madly.  Don��t get me wrong, there is still real bass and the head rattling experience is fun.  But don��t be mislead into thinking the feeling is from the actual power of the drivers or the sound itself - it is a vibrator for your ears.",3,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Wes VK,WOW! Just... WOW!,"After like 9 sets of over-ear headphones, I've FINALLY found my winner! I've heard other Skullcandy stuff before, so I'd have literally chosen these DEAD LAST for who I suspected would be my favorite. I literally scowled at their stuff when I saw it in stores. NOT ANYMORE!!! I'll start with the cons, since that's the easiest thing to get out of the way.Cons: My only complaint is comfort. They aren'y UNcomfortable, they're just NOT comfortable. But for the first time ever, I don't even remotely care. They clamp tighter than I like (I use them for VERY long sessions, so the lighter, the better). Also, the cups are slightly too small for my ears to relax in. Most people as picky about sound as me (I'm literally a sound guy) can hear that they aren't ""premium"" in that department. These are NOT for listening to lossless sound, but if you're dealing with lossless, why are you even dabbling in this price bracket, yo? But as someone that can HEAR a VBR mp3 change it's bitrate, these still sound great overall.Pros: Can definitely feel a more premium material feel than sub $100, so that's good. The slit on top for bald guys is actually VERY nice! Only time I've ever seen that and it DOES make a difference! I can't believe I'm gonna say this about Skullcrusher, but the sound is actually AWESOME. I always hate having to EQ new sets for an hour or 2 as soon as I get em. These are exactly where I like it, out of the box. Maybe a TINY bit more lows could be better, but I'd rather just leave it because of the bass ""booster"". It doesn't actually bring out any more bass than what's there, it's more like a vibrator for your headset (and depending how high you set it, your actual head, lol). What's neat is that it actually REALLY improves the listening experience WITHOUT having to ruin how it sounds! REALLY adds to immersion when gaming, ESPECIALLY in racing games where you can FEEL your V8! Easily the COOLEST feature of ANY headphone set anywhere!Conclusion: I'm going to have to slowly buy more of these, because I don't think I can ever go back to regular  sets after this. That ""booster"" is THAT cool! No BS, before half ""boost"", these can BLUR YOUR VISION! Doing something where you don't want that? They were BRILLIANT and put the slider for it on the other side, so it's VERY easy to find, away from everything else.The greatest word choice in the WORLD cannot do these things justice. You have to EXPERIENCE them to understand them. But go ahead and pass on them. More inventory for me to eventually buy anyway!",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Jason Chavez,An Amazing Piece of Tech With! Truly An Ineffable Listening Experience!,"I typically don��t write reviews, but due to the vague misleading reviews online and overshadowed by others headphone competitors and being unsure of the brand �Skullcandy��, you may have been in my same situation: I wasn��t sure if I should go through with the purchase.Background: I am an avid music listener using Spotify on average at least 3 hours a day.  I currently use the Bose QC 35 II and Powerbeats Pro��s as my typical day-to-day headphones/ear buds and love them.  I am the definition of a bass head.Recommendation: I will be honest, out of the box, the mid��s and high��s are not as bright as people hyped them up to be online.  HOWEVER, Spotify has the feature to be able to equalize your music and allows you to download them at a higher quality.  By boosting the mid��s and high��s, it brings the headphones to life.  Without equalization, the headphones are good, but by equalizing the music, the experience is surreal, surpassing any headphones I��ve used in my life (the haptic engines are not a gimmick).  The bass on these headphones is mesmerizing (my teeth slightly chatter on some bass heavy songs with very low frequencies).  I also DJ��d for a couple of years and to those who understand speakers and subwoofers, I would compare these headphones as like you had an independent dedicated 15�� subwoofer and at times even an 18�� subwoofer to handle the low end frequencies.  An amazing engineering feat is that the haptic engines are working independently to the 40 mm drivers; it��s like having a dedicated subwoofer to your listening experience and can be adjusted at anytime with the slider.  Therefore, when you hit a low 30hz frequency/note, it assigns the task to the haptic engines to reproduce the low end frequency; the mids and lows aren��t distorted (impressive).  Without stretching the truth, the technology under the hood is closest thing I��ve seen in a while to revolutionizing the headphone itself (last time I personally feel this was accomplished was with active noise cancelation).  These headphone have made me stay up late listening to my favorite songs and reliving them with a totally new experience.  I��m sad to see my Bose headphones sounded flat and honestly, boring after using the Skullcandy headphones.  Construction is really good and and fit is comfortable, although not as comfortable and light as the Bose QC 35��s.  Although there is no ANC on these headphones, at high volume you would feel these headphones have ANC on board.  All in all, equalized, these headphones are amazing (10/10).  Therefore, if you don��t have the ability to equalize the headphones through your music streaming service, I wouldn��t be able whole heartily recommend them since I personally feel you are not using them to their full potential; sadly the headphones can��t be equalized through their app to affect the overall experience regardless what app/device you use.

Nick,Tooth chipping bass,"I have now owned the last 2 revisions of the Crusher Evo's, and the original Crushers. This revision pounds harder than the last 2 I've owned, by a considerable amount. You won't find any headphones with bass harder than these under $600. By far the best dollar/decibel ratio. The bass does bleed into the mids a bit, but when you buy headphones that focus solely on the bass, what do you expect?",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
shivalshival,Bass is next level �������,Best wireless headphone out there without anc. Trust me choose this over crusher ANC which is almost same price now as this is most newer version and have better build and refined bass in my opinion. These headphones are on whole another level in terms of bass with good sound quality and As we know ANC on more premium crusher ANC is just a gimmick. And have a annoying hissing sound in my personal experience which is noticeable while playing pubg and watching movies. So these are the best i wish they have anc as well and a hardshell carrying case but headphone only is more than enough for me,5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Derek AubeDerek Aube,"Amazing, but one small problem for wired users.","I'm a basshead and these things far surpassed my expectations in terms of bass. Seriously I couldn't help but laugh at how crazy it is that they literally vibrate on your head. Artificial bass or not they sound incredible to me and EQ made them even better. HOWEVER, I had two issues with them, first being the stock earpads and how small they are. I found them very uncomfortable after wearing them for about a half hour with the stock ear pads. They were just too small and would sit on the lobe of my ear, so I took a leap and ordered replacement ear pads made by Wicked Cushions, specifically the model made for the Audio Technica ATH-M50x as a user on Reddit said they fit perfect and sure enough they do and now they sit perfectly on my ears they are very comfortable now. If you order them just know that there isn't as much noise cancellation and slightly more leakage, wasn't a big deal for me personally.Secondly, now heres the big issue for me and is solely the reason these aren't 5 stars from me. When using them wired while powered on (they need to be powered on to utilize the Bass feature, the whole point of the headphones essentially) they emit a constant hiss/hum noise. I read that others have reported that the Chill Grey version is absent of this issue however for me that was not the case. At first I had ordered them in Black and my Dad listened to them and ended up wanting a pair as well and got the Chill Grey version. I compared them and can confirm there was no difference in the hiss/hum. Both headphone had it and it was at the exact same volume. One wasn't better or worse than the other. And this issue isn't caused by a bad cable or ground, it is a problem in the headphone itself. When listening to music it isn't really an issue, but if your like me sitting at your computer and browsing the internet with nothing playing hearing this constant very audible hum is VERY annoying and i'm having a hard time tuning it out. I'm really disappointed about this and its the only reason I cant use them as my daily drivers because its all I can focus on when I have them on with no audio playing.",4,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

The headphone top band is the worst I have seen in any headphones. The two little bumps that are off center push into your head for the most discomfort. I have wore headphones for gaming for years and never any discomfort. I also just bought some Steel Series 9X that have been the most comfortable headset I have ever owned.

KasKas,God bless these headphones,"The media could not be loaded.                 �Prepare for a long review!These are the best headphones i��ve ever owned in my life. I am a huge music / gaming nerd so I go through a lot of headsets but these are the best for music.The feel of the headset is sturdy but not heavy. It��s definitely for smaller heads, but on my small head they��re super comfy. The padding on the ears is soft and mailable. It doesn��t feel like rocks on my ear like beats�� Most comfortable headphone i��ve tried, besides the apple headphones. (but don��t buy those they��re trash, no bass and super quiet)The interface is super simple and the app is amazing. It has its own equalizers, and you can make one based off of your own ears and what tones you can hear which is really sweet for me because I have bad hearing in my left ear so I was able to cater to that.The headset comes with its own carrying case lined with fur and three compartments. They fold super nicely and Im not scared of breaking them.In comparison with other headphones i��ve tried, they��re louder than beats and the apple headset, they��re bassier than both, the noise cancelling isn��t great but better than beats. They��re more comfortable than beats but not the apple headset. Overall they��re the best headphone on the market for the price, especially if you��re looking for something that is going to turn your brain to goo from the bass.(sorry for shaky photos, health problem)",5,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Cayla KCayla K,Bass you can feel!,"Been looking for a new pair of headphones since my current ones were going on five years. After going through so many and being super indecisive I settled on these and love them. I only have a couple of nitpicking things, everything else are pros.PROS:- Amazing sound and bass. I like the fact that they come with an aux cable so I can use them with my Nintendo Switch which doesn't have Bluetooth, and I can still get the bass function with it.- Long battery life. It advertises 40 hours and I was able to use it since I got it on the 6th to the 14th without charging it out of the box, it was on 80% and just now reaching 20%. On average, I'd use 5/7 hours a day if not longer for different things.- Comfortable. I can wear these for hours and not notice them. I don't have a big head and I wear glasses.- I like that they fold and feel kind of premium when you hold them.- I like the color options but wish there were more. I wanted something other than black for a change so I went with grey.- It comes with a two year warranty in Canada too.- The personalized app. I saw some people say they like how it sounds without but I disagree. I like playing around with it.- I have noticed no latency issues across devices ( Android and Windows, no iPhone here ,) and Bluetooth works well. I can go around the house without issues unlike my other ones that cut out when I went out of the room.- There is no ANC but it does cancel out some noise.CONs:- When it gets to 20%, you'll start to hear constant ""battery low"" notifications in your ear that cut out what you're listening to. Wish you could disable those.- While I like the folding feature, I'm nervous to use it. It feels kind of flimsy and could potentially break.- The app sometimes disconnects and loses the setting it was on so you'll have to turn it on again. It does seem to keep up across devices though ( i.e. you can use it on the laptop not just phone )- There is a constant hissing noise when on wired mode. I don't personally hear it when I'm actually listening to anything so it doesn't bother me enough. If you don't need the bass, the only way to cancel it out is to turn off the headphones when using them wired.- To get the full headbanging vibrating bass experience, the volume has to be at least 50% if not 60% or higher, and I find for my ears personally that's too loud so I don't feel it very often. There is lots of base even without it rattling the head though.Don't use microphones on headphones so I can't comment on those. Aside from my little nitpicks I love them and would recommend them, they are a really fun experience if you like bass!",4,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
JusticeJustice,These are the best cans I have ever bought!,"Quality quality quality! These are the headsets you get for all around performance! Movies and music I use them and by far super sick! Truly the goods! Noise cancellation what, we don��t have it, did you want not want to feel involved in the action! Ask anyone about an affordable pair of headphones to sound good with nois cancellation. Ok between my old headphones Sol and Boltune which for on a lower price range had Beats on the run and for the money! Comfortable and last for the time you will enjoy on your head for the time you use them. 40 hours is dope but I��m not taking a test on my ears for that long! Long story short these are a cross version headphones that work all across different platforms! No amp??? Ok buy the system setup, this is out the box with the app tuner is something to be talked about because I remember listening to headphones that are meant to be flat but this is not flat, juicy sounds!

Will,Completely ridiculous (in a fun way),"I got these the other night, turned the bass slider up all the way, put on Skrillex's new album (Quest for Fire) to test them out and was blown away.With the bass slider down all the way, these sound good. Probably on par with my old Anker Soundcores. With the bass slider up all the way, though? They feel unlike any other headphones I've ever owned. The bass is so powerful that it feels like my brain is going to get dislodged. It's like being up against a subwoofer at a club except it's all around your head. They vibrate so much that it feels like a massage chair for your ears.Prolonged exposure to this would probably give me a headache, but for an album or two at a time? It absolutely rules. I couldn't stop laughing when I first experienced it. It's wild in the best way. Definitely something that needs to be experienced for yourself, though. Videos don't quite do it justice.I suppose I could leave the bass slider right in the middle for more of a balanced sound, but what fun would that be? I got these for the totally over the top bass effect that was promised in some video reviews I watched for these, and they definitely deliver. When I use these out in public, though, I'll probably have to turn the bass slider all the way down. I have a feeling that if I left it all the way up, I'd get some nasty looks.As a bass lover, I never want to own another pair of headphones now that I've seen what these can do. They're the type of audio equipment that makes me want to go back and listen to every album I've ever loved so I can experience the bass in those albums in a new way.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
RobertCharlesRobertCharles,Sound Quality and Build Quality,"The media could not be loaded.                 �The Skull Candy Crushers, I've been a fan of these series, but I'll try and keep this review as at an unbiased look.Sound Quality: Surprisingly the treble is very clear for being such a bass driven set of headphones. The quality to me is pretty close to the 2nd gen (These are the 3rd generation) but the bass seems deeper and punchier with more clarity, overall it has a good sound but these headphones favor bass heavily, even with the bass slider off completely they do keep a bit of punch. I find the bass does not drown out the treble either which is incredibly nice. While they're extremely clear and have great bass response, they tend to cut off fairly quickly at the low range (30hz is the lowest they play) as being such a bass focused headset i feel like they should reproduce low frequency ranges (sub 30s) a lot better, so be careful with some heavy bass tunes. When enabling the EQ, i haven't noticed a large difference in sound quality, it's maybe slightly clearer sounding but that's about it.Build Quality: I'd personally say build quality is about average, should be a bit better for the price range i find, the construction is mostly plastic with some soft fabric at the top of the headband, they do fold very nicely for compact storage and come with a bag, you can easily wear these for a few hours without straining your ears, clamping force is good too. I personally think the Crushers should be made of more high quality materials if Skullcandy wants to go for the High End market, it is an improvement over the 2nd generation though, the 2nd generation had issues with plastics cracking (atleast with me and my large head) and for the price point, you really should get a hard shell case instead of a bag, the bag isn't water proof although it looks it. P.S bonus points for having an AUX plug and coming with a cable, nice to use with my amplifier.Bass Slider: The bass slider is a good feature, ive seen some people complain about it being too sensitive, which can be true if you aren't careful, a small adjustment means a lot.Battery Life: battery life is impressive for driving so much bass tones, and the quick charge feature is great to have and works very well, i enjoy the USB C connection for future proofing and quick charge. I also noticed that you cant use the bass slider in aux mode unless the headphones are powered on, which makes sense, but there tends to be a large amount of static when in auxiliary mode with the headphones on, unlike Bluetooth mode.",4,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Amazon Customer,bang for your buck,after years of my friend telling me to try the skullcandy crushers wireless i decided to go for the new updated and upgraded version of those and OMG these things are much better than i expected beautiful sound and the bass boost �My only gripe is trying to connect with the skullcandy app as when i turn them on they instantly pair with my Bluetooth and the app connect in the same way and when it connects to the app while already connected with the regular phones Bluetooth the sound starts cutting in and out as i play music anyone knows how to fix this issue please share,4,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Georgia Jurcic,Bass goes crazy but vocals have no depth & are really flat,"There are absolutely no reverby sounds or depth which is why I was so excited to get them bc that plus extra bass is so fire but like I said the voices are really flat and overpowered by the bass. I thought I was a bass head bc I listen to a lot of edm but the bass is way too much even on a low setting. If you want the experience of blasting music in a car (not a large room) that favors the rattling bass over vocals then you might like these. I tried out the personalized setting on the skullcandy app too but it made little to no difference. Pretty disappointed, Im going to try audio technica for better luck! Also in terms of design it feels really plastic-y but looks nice. The ear parts swivel horizontally all the way but don��t move up and down much. I��ve got a smaller head and they fit well but I don��t think these are big head friendly :( I hoped for a hard case but it comes with a pouch, so skullcandy probably made some sacrifices lowering the quality of other features to make the bass feature stand out. Big womp I��m returning mine tomorrow",1,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Devin,Awesome headphones! Eye rattling BASS!,"If you want ridiculous bass for music or gaming or movies these are the right choice, the bass is completely ridiculous. Even on the lowest it is pretty intense but at full blast some songs rattle my eyeballs, no joke. I'm not an audiophile so i can't tell you if these are great sound quality wise but they are the best headphones I'VE ever had. Battery life is great too, 40 hours on a single charge, and if they die, you plug them in to charge and the 1st 10 minutes gives you 3 hours of emergency listening, I've only had them run out once and that was after a few days of gaming and I forgot to charge them. The charger is usb c(into headphones)to usb a(into laptop, pc, phone charger, etc.). They look nice too and they are comfy. They also come with a 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm cord one end plugs into the headphones the other into device. Bluetooth works great and I've never had a signal drop when I'm anywhere in my apartment, i tried going downstairs and out of my building(I'm on the third floor)and they actually worked for a bit, then it got spotty and then the connection dropped entirely so I'd estimate the max range is maybe 15-30 metres or 50-100 feet? The ear cups are soft and comfy and removable. There's also an app that works for these but i haven't used it much. These headphones are compatible with the ""Tile"" system so if you lose them you can use that to find them. Phone calls can be answered and ended with a press of the centre button on the right side of the back of the ear cup and that's where the volume buttons are too, you can skip music tracks too. The left ear cup has the power/pairing button and the BASS slider, the slider goes from ridiculous to straight ludicrous. The bass will probably make me deaf in the long run but it was worth it. Great headphones. The bass is ACTUALLY insane, it's not just marketing hype. I don't think these have ANC but the bass is so intense i can't hear anything anyways. The only thing i noticed that i don't like is when i have them connected with the included 3.5 mm audio cord there is a high pitched whine, it can only be heard when there is no music or audio playing so i didn't take a star off but i wanted to mention it so maybe Skullcandy could fix it with the next model. And I'm seeing seeing a few reviews saying they break easily? Any headphones will break if you sit on them. I've had mine since April 2021 and they work great still and aren't broken cause i haven't sat on them and if yours did spontaneously crack then I'm sorry. I saw review say that when he turned up the volume on his hifi stereo these distort then said that his other headphones(which cost $900), and i quote ""aren't afraid of the volume"" like, umm, OF COURSE your headphones that cost $700 more dollars than these will be better. But for this lowly peasant these will do.�",5,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Michele from Michigan,Have a hearing problem? These are the *BEST* headphones for that,"I had a virus that did damage to my hearing and as a result, have severe hearing loss at a younger age than you would expect.  Since that point - I have hated most of my headphones because the hearing loss is in the middle of the sound spectrum.  My hearing aids sound fine and I can run my music through them - but they don��t give you the immersive feel I remember and miss about a great pair of headphones.  These EVO��s do a quick and dirty hearing test with an app - their findings in less than 3 minutes look spot on to the audiologists report - and the app lets me use a program that optimized for me. When I added sliding the haptic Bass Switch to the max - it was as if the whole world of sound opened back up to me.  I am not saying you could use these as hearing aids - and I just unboxed them so I have no way to speak for longevity - but for my personal situation?I almost cried it sounded so great.  It was like having my hearing back and being next to a speaker during a live concert again.It��s having 3D sound all around my head and it��s amazing.",5,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Arya Stark,Still the best bass,"I've been using the Crusher Wireless for about 5 years. They developed a soft crackling in sound during this last year, so felt it was time to get them replaced. When I bought Wireless, the 360's had *just* came out, and I didn't know it lol Well I'm not missing out this time. Got the best of the Crushers to date. Evo is basically Wireless, just better. By a lot.If on PC, use your equalizer system to tweak the sounds. The Crusher app that adjusts to ""your unique hearing"" isn't good, to be honest. I have a ASUS system, so I use Realtek Audio Console in conjunction with Sonic Studio 3 software that came with my board.Using an equalizer is totally optional. You know, after you're done messing with the thrills of the bass slider and ready to listen to your headphones like a normal person :DHow much bass?You will rarely ever need to have the bass slider up more than a pinch. I love bass, and I'm telling you this. With the old Wireless, I always had the slider up about halfway point. These are fantastic for gaming and action movies, too!MicMic isn't good but it's not unusable.ChargeThey really do last a long time and really adds 3 hours per 10min charge.Noise cancellingThe bass is your noise canceller, okay? lolQualityWireless was known for breaking at the earcups. Mine never did and are still in perfect condition. The Evo's build quality is a lot better. Very nice and sturdy. No creaking. They fit slightly snug. Earcups get uncomfortable after an hour but really depends on person. Earcup padding is replaceable can find some after market stuff for something better.

Katina,OUT OF THIS WORLD,"Okay let me start by saying I never ever write reviews. This is one of my first reviews so here it goes:I grew up with headphones on my head. Constantly listening to music especially rap and electro. For 9 years I have been pursuing the best Bass headphones. I love bass, I am obsessed with bass. It's always been a struggle to find headphones that have enough bass. I bought countless of pairs with the ''promise of good bass''. Every single time I go like ''Meh I guess it's fine, they just have not yet figured out the technology to put a real subwoofer inside a headset'' . Last years I got my hopes up when my mom gifted me the Scullcandy Venue. The bass was pretty good but I was still not satisfied. 1 month ago I broke my Venue's in the gym and was quite disheartened. I started searching again for headphones and went on the best seller list on Amazon and bought a pair for �35 (they promised they had a bass boost as my venues did). Well when you pay peanuts you get monkeys. So I returned them immediately and started researching. After 5 long days of research I found out that these are the headphones that are considered the best in terms of bass and the best in terms of quality/value.Long story short today I was blasted away. After 9 long years the technology is finally here. This is INSAAAAAAANE. They have been 5 hours on my head and are still on my head as I write this review. I have a huge headache but nevertheless I can't help but enjoy it. My teeth are shaking and I can feel the bass behind my eyeballs. If you are looking to gift someone a pair of Headphones THIS IS IT ! I Promise you if he is not impressed I will pay you seriously. They managed to impress me who has not been impressed for 9 long years. I showed them to my friends today and recorded their reactions. They couldn't believe their ears. All of them ended up buying a pair immediately.When the product is so god damn good it's just a no brainer.It's like someone just offered you a 1 kg bar of gold for �140. Would you take it?Best Christmas for me for sure.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Beep Beep Richie,The headphones I have been looking for my WHOLE LIFE,"Seriously. I have been sitting here with my jaw to the ground after playing ""Supersonic (My existence)"" by Skrillex for the third time.I just want everyone to know that I am obsessed with bass. I have severe ADHD and if you don't know this about people like me, or people with Autism - some of us have a serious emotional reaction to certain stimuli/sensory. Mine is mostly with music and smell. Bass gives me an unreal physical response so whenever I look for headphones or car audio, that is the first thing I look for.I've had the same pair of Sony extra bass (I forget which ones) since 2014, They've been with me all over the world, deployments, you name it. They are falling apart now and I wasn't able to detach myself from them because of how nice the bass sounds. It actually came down to the fact that those headphones are not wireless and I was getting tired of not being able to walk around freely so - the hunt began.I saw the reviews for these and decided to give them a shot.I. was. not. disappointed.These are insane and I don't think I will be able to take them off, ever. The sound is crisp - I can control how much bass I want to hear which is helpful because despite my love for it, not every song sounds good with the bass up at 100%.Highly recommend if you are a bass head like I am. My cheeks are rattling like I'm on a bumpy back road and I'm sure that my lack of self control will lead me to a headache later tonight but it's going to be so worth it.SkullCandy you have won over my heart and my future damaged cochlea.",5,B093STJV1G,Colour: Dark Blue,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Alex Sp,Level up zum Vorgnger,"Habe die Crusher Wireless ungefhr 5 Jahre in Benutzung gehabt. Mittlererweile sind diese aber in die Jahre gekommen. Gehuse verfrbt sich und Ohr Polsterung lst sich auf. Noch dazu hat sich an der Technik irgendwas gelockert, man hrt ab und an ein vibrieren aus dem Kopfhrer.Wie dem auch sei 5 Jahre lang jedes Mal Spa gehabt.Egal ob beim Haushalt, Reisen, Sport die crusher wireless waren Immer die erste Wahl.Nun musste aber was neues her.Habe lange geliebugelt mit dem Evo und dachte eigentlich das man den cw nicht mehr toppen kann. Ich wurde aber besserem belehrt.Kopfhrer bestellt f�r ~ 140 Euro.Aufgesetzt, personalisiert und getestet.Beim ersten Mal fallen einem schon etliche Verbesserungen auf, drehbare Ohrmuscheln, Verarbeitung und Haptik der Regler, Aussehen des Kopfhrers usw.Die neue Stimme der Kopfhrer, die ""power on"" etc sagt ist wirklich viel angenehmer als beim Vorgnger.Zum Klang muss man sagen, dass die Kopfhrer �ber ein sehr gut abgestimmtes Gesamtpaket verf�gen.Wo es beim CW fast nur um Bass ging bekommt man hier wirklich jeden zufrieden gestellt.Der hapticbass oder wie man es nennen mag (das was den Kopfhrer so besonders macht) kommt nicht nur beim kickbass ordentlich zur Geltung sondern kann jetzt auch lange richtig tiefe baselines sehr gut aufs Ohr bringen. Als ich von $uicdeboy$ Carrollton gehrt hab war mir klar was beim Evo geht. Wer das Lied kennt wei was ich meine.Jeder dem ich den Kopfhrer aufgesetzt habe, hat direkt ein Lcheln im Gesicht.Auch ohne den haptischen Bass ist Evo eine Wucht.

Vernal ScottVernal Scott,Mega Skull-Busting Sound For the Brave,"I thought I was happy with my cheap old August EP650 headphones, but a popular you tube reviewer made me curious about this Evo set and I took the plunge. I put some Beyonce on my Tab S7+ via Bluetooth and when the bass hit me I had to pick my head up off the floor. I then had to go next door to collect my ears. This headset is beyond insane. I never heard anything like it; not just bass but highs and mids, too. I haven't tried the related app yet because using Poweramp to turn up the volume even more works for me. The Evo is very comfortable to use and isn't at all heavy. The controls, including the wickedly effective bass slider, are easy to reach and manipulate to my liking. Design wise, the Evo looks pretty unassuming for its price, but that's not a complaint. Overall, the Evo is the equivalent of putting a mega DJ sound system on your head. Expect to be moved in more ways than you can imagine. The only downside: I'll miss the ability to scan through a long track to get to my favourite bits.

Beach Bum,Too much of a good thing?,"I love bass. Growing up listening primarily to hip hop, R&B, and jazz, bass is the heartbeat of the music I most listen to. I��ve used Xtrabass headphones as well as haptic enabled gaming headsets, so I was curious about haptic enabled music headphones. Sound quality is surprisingly good. Usually bass heavy headphones are a one-trick pony with excellent bass and little else. These Crusher evo cans sound excellent across the entire sound profile. Highs, mids, and lows sound equally good with no tones overpowering the other. That is unless the bass slider is slid to higher levels. That��s when things get interesting. Using the bass slider is much more convenient than app-based bass controls. However, Skullcandy does offer an app for more granular tuning and control. Just be aware that sliding beyond a quarter increase in bass intensity can result in a little too much bass. Not only does the intense, physically felt, pounding bass almost entirely overpower all other notes but it actually becomes a little painful due to the haptic feedback. I get both earaches and headaches after extensive listening. In fairness, I get the same from my haptic enabled gaming headset if I turn the haptics up to the highest levels. So, these are excellent sounding if the bass is kept to lower levels. Problem is, the head rattling bass is the biggest selling point. I guess it depends on each listener��s tolerance. As far as build quality, these feel solidly constructed and well crafted with a nice premium feel. Not a big fan of the storage pouch and would much rather it have a rigid storage case like the similarly priced and quality competition but it��s not a dealbreaker by any means. Overall, the Crusher Evo are great sounding and solidly crafted. They don��t have ANC but the seal and passive noise blocking from the cup design is actually pretty good. It blocks mild to moderate household sounds when I��m listening. Obviously it��s not as robust as ANC but unless commuting on public transportation or frequently using the headphones in loud noisy environments, ANC isn��t really necessary to create a nice isolated soundstage, which these do well. Just go easy on the bass if you want music to remain listenable and to not have to possibly take an aspirin later for head and ear aches.",4,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Peaches C. ,Are you a nerodivergent that loves to experience your music?

The sound quality is really really good the bass doesn't distort the sound quality, they are built very nice and have some weight to them. They also come with built in Tile which comes in handy if you miss place things around the house, they come with a nice case that is plush on the inside and has pockets to hold the charging cable and AUX cable.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Samir BaruahSamir Baruah,Unmatched !,"First, I must admit that I am not a ""bass buddy"". So, when I heard everybody saying about the quality of bass in this device , I was little bit worried. More often it is seen that too much of bass effects sound quality of any device. But this comes as a pleasant surprise. Yes, these are  bass heavy headphones. I haven't heard such base in any othet equipment before. This is awesome not just because of bass but for its overall sound quality. You can hear every little nuances of music . However, you can control the base with the slider provided here. You can also receive additional help from skulcandy app. In one sentence : The sound quality is amazing. (Even if you are not after base like me, you will also enjoy).Comfort level is good. Though it's not too light, still it doesn't feel heavy on me. Build quality is superb. Total value for money product.Well, if you prefer studio like sound quality you can go for AKG or Audio technica . I am telling you from my own experience. But trust me even then you will not be disappointed with these pair of headphones. Instead of that , some added bass will transport you to another level of experience. Mind blowing !!!",5,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Evan tulay,"Not a ""balanced"" experience, but still great.","These headphones are definitely not meant for everyone. Their main selling feature is the bass slider, which at max bass is just complete overkill. It feels like a head massage. It's awesome. At lower levels the bass is actually really good, and much more suited for actual listening.Everything else about the headset is pretty much average for the price point.The mic is fine. If you're just taking a call from a family member or friend, they'll be able to understand you clearly enough. If you're going to go into a professional setting I would definitely recommend using a different mic.The sound quality is good, but if you're a stickler for that kind of thing you're probably better off looking at something from sony, sennheiser or audio technica; you'll get much better sound quality at a similar price point. The sound profile is actually pretty solid, but it obviously has a huge spike in the base. Sound stage also isn't too impressive.The build quality leaves some to be desired, but I wouldn't describe it as cheap or poor. The buttons are a bit too clicky, and the slider is a bit scratchy. Most of the casing is plastic, but it's not cheap plastic, and the inner headband has some metal in it. The padding on the ears is nice, but the headband could use a little more. On the top of the headband is some felt like material, which is a really bad choice. It gets a ton of hair stuck on it and looks kind of bad.These are not the ANC model. Background noise is pretty noticeable in loud areas like a plane or bus. If that's something you're concerned about, avoid these. The bass is also going to be very noticeable to people around you if turned up. I wouldn't recommend these to someone who commutes a lot, they're much more suited for either home use or gym goers.",4,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Sam Hartsaw,BEST,"The media could not be loaded.                 �I��d like to first start off with the are probably the best headphone i��ve ever i had.

Ash,"Finally, headphones out the box with BASS","I can rattle on for pages on headphones having owned something new every 6 months for the past decade. From Sennheiser, Bose, Dre Beats, Pioneer, Shure, RHD, Jabra, JVC, Kenwood seriously the list goes on, I've had them all.The thing I've been searching for are Bluetooth headphones straight out the box that provide unparalleled amounts of bass without having to use an amp. These paired with my Samsung Note20 Ultra playing dub/d&b/UK garage/Hip-Hop/R&B sound ridiculous. I have to have the bass set to around half as these will give ur ear drums a serious pounding.Sound wise overall, not bad, especially given that they have an app to create a personalised sound profile. Tbh, if I want to listen to music in its crisp format, to hear the highs, mids and lows, I've got other headphones for this purpose. However, if I want a massive grin on my face because my whole face is rattling and the low sound of bass that kicks in during a track that makes you jump comes on, then these are the cans for u!!! The physical sensation these bring to the table is amazing - it's like being sat in my brother's car that has two 15 inch sundown subs. There are certain frequencies these headphones won't like but anything between 25k/30k-60k hz sounds amazing. I tried them with some ultra low music which are tracks you can find online that have had the bass customised to a lower frequency purposefully. Anything lower than 25k hz they didn't really like. Also, punchy bass was a bit of headache after a while - they prefer that rolling bass at the frequencies pointed out above.The only thing for me that compares to these are my JVC Kenwood HA-SZ2000's paired with the Fiio BTR5. Those have a more crisp overall sound whilst delivering amazing lows but these will set u back anything between �750-�1250 brand new and the BTR5 just over �100.Therefore, in conclusion, for �120 squid, decent build quality and lovely fit (for my odd shaped head anyways) these are by far the best sounding ""straight out the box"" bass headphones I've come across on the market so far.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
jonathan bolton,Crisp and clean sign with bass that kicks ass!!!!,"I got a pair from my friend well she gave me the money because recently I had lost my wireless skullcandy uproar, so my friend got me a pair of Bowers and Walkins PX5 which were rubbish paired to my mobile so tinny and had no bass but plugged in to my pc they were great. So sent them back because I found these Skullcandy Crushers Evo because there were alot cheaper and the sound is so crisp and clean and being able to adjust the bass due to slider on the side above the power button.There is so many pros to these headphones I highly recommend and they beat so many headphones out there like bowers also bose the crusher evo is highend even though they are not priced over �150There are a couple of cons for me with these headphones, one is at top there is a felt material on top of the heaphones and if you have a dog or put it down on a dusty surface the felt just collects everything, another is the finish on the headphones no matter what you do it always picks up finger prints the biggest one for me though is the power button I am so used to it being on the right handside in the middle of the volume buttons.I do highly recommend these headphones but please take notes the Crushers are just the same as the Crusher Evo and they are cheaper only thing is they have two wires in top of the headphones.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
FurbyFurby,Ultimately Overpriced,"At this price point, you can find significantly better headphones. Here is a list of Pros and Cons.Likes:Bass adjustment - turn the bass up all the way if you want your headphones to rattle from the bass.Charge - They charge quick and last quite awhile.Comfort - I like the oval earpiece on these compared to the perfectly round earpieces on some other models.Dislikes:Call quality - Compared to other comparably priced headphones, outgoing sound quality is Poor (static, cutting out, etc.). Incoming is average.Connection drops - After about 10-15 minutes connected to a device on Bluetooth, it starts to cut out. Noticed multiple times while watching movies.Turning on and off - It sounds like the voice says �Power off�� when turning device either on or off.Noise cancellation- These are not noise cancelingRange is average.Bottom line: The only thing that makes these better than my Bose headphones is the adjustable bass. Otherwise, these are comparable to low end headphones and, in some cases, worse.",1,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
T. AnsariT. Ansari,Best sound quality in this range,"No comparison with any other brand in this range. Battery backup is extremely good with fast charging feature. Got it @ INR 11749/-Lacking feature of dual pairing for power users.

Base is over powering but can be handled with the slider.Overall best in this range, but as said can be little cheaper.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Shawn N,"Very clear audio, bass is crazy strong if you use that slider","There's a bass slider and its ridiculously strong.  Audio quality is very good in general, better than I had hoped for in this price range.These do not have noise-cancelling, which I appreciate.  Active noise cancellation hurts my head and my ears after using headphones for a short period of time.  I have not found a brand of noise cancellation that does not cause me discomfort.  I'm glad that Skullcandy offers a great quality headphone without active noise cancellation.The frame is very solid, does not feel cheap at all.  I'm worried about the hinges, especially the folding part. However, they really do feel well constructed.  The band is plastic but feels extremely sturdy.  When you extend the band, you'll see that there is a metal strip underneath that gives it more strength.  At the top of the headband there is a cushion that is soft and covered with a plastic material (unlike some of my other headphones that used a leather-type material) for durability I suppose.I had thought the earpads might be too small for my ears (they appear to be) but they were very comfortable and fit well.  The material for the earpads is very soft.I was hesitant to purchase these headphones because I've never purchased good non-Sony headphones in a very long time but am pleasantly surprised.UPDATE:The bass slider is not actual bass.  It vibrates the headphones to stimulate the feel of bass.. Still pretty fun and it gives your head a massage kinda.Hinges are way too stiff, so the cups don't properly sit over your ears until you struggle with manually adjusting them.  Once they are in place they're stuck because of the friction.  If you try to adjust one ear, the whole headset moves.I wish the top band was not so tight and the ear cups rotated more easily.  The folding feature is not something I needed, makes them feel fragile.  Starting to get ear fatigue when wearing for long periods of time, probably because the ear cups aren't deep enough.These headphonesare apparently ok with rain, or I got lucky lol.UPDATE 2: The headphones now squeak when the cups are rotated.  I'm trying to use sandpaper to sand down the parts that are rubbing.  Nothing is more ridiculous than having to keep adjusting these cups every time they're removed and put back on, with them squeaking the whole time.You guys need to get rid of this silly folding part and focus on a very smooth rotation so they can adjust to a person's head easily. Too much pressure from the hinges sticking causes discomfort.",3,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Amazon Customer,The only headphones I've ever found with a lot of bass.,"For years I've been searching for headphones with a lot of bass and a lot of volume. I've gone through so many web searches for headphones with both, and I'm always disappointed with what I get. Finally I've come to this set. Now first off, I like my music louder and I like more bass than most people, I think. For what that's worth. I find these headphones... loud enough for sort-of loud listening for long periods. I'd like them to be louder, but if they were, they wouldn't really be safe for long-term listening. So they're adequate from that point of view. Now the bass, is where these really shine. I never thought I'd find headphones that had TOO MUCH bass, but these headphones can get there. These headphones produce surprisingly solid and deep bass. I thought the vibration effect was going to be a gimmick that I would just turn off, but unlike other Skullcandy earphones, this effect works. Even with the bass adjustment slider at only 20%, music has a very full, solid bottom end. When I do some rap with a lot of bass, I can turn the slider up more, and although it's nowhere near as loud, it's similar to being in a car with good subwoofers, just surrounding you with bass. Listening to rock and heavy metal, the drums and bass are much more full and really gives the music some body. I really wish I could get another, like 3 db out of these headphones, but so far they're pretty usable for listening to music all day long while I'm working. And if you like bass, trust me, these headphones are the only game in town. Don't even bother with anything else, it'll be crap.",4,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
IceQ,Skullcrusher more like,"Pros. Comfortable  Excellent sound reproduction  Bass, like your never going to find  anywhere ele  Feels more premium & durable than  the previous model (skullcandy  crusher)  Carry case (best I've come across so  far)  Battery life (10 min rapid charge)  Ease of use, button placement  Cons.  Unlike previous model these  will only allow the crusher bass once  powered on  Price �150Skullcandy crusher evo, they are definitely a step up from the original crusher, sound is sweet and you can adjust how much of that skull crushing bass you want via a slider on the side of the cup, you've got your usual type c port for charging, an aux cable, a type c charging cable, you've got power button and volume up, down which also serve as track forward or back too. The button placement and the buttons themselves are really good, what I mean is I've come across headphones in the past with some real crappy buttons, hard to press and in weird places (panasonic) but these are easy to navigate and press too, they feel very premium with soft touch feel paint job, they fold easily and feel smooth. I've not experienced any discomfort from these, yeah your ears may get a little sweaty with prolonged use but tell me one headphone that doesn't do that. Connected flawlessly to everything I connected it to, there is an app you can download and tinker with the settings, the app pretty basic in my opinion. Carry case is amazing in my opinion, first time I've seen a carry case that's come with the headset feeling just as premium as the headphones themselves but not only that it's actually functional too, it has a buckle on it, you put the headphones inside twist the top two times and buckle up, keeps them nice and secure,If your on the edge thinking about the price then yeah it is a little steep at �150 a pop but it's oh so worth it honestly, I highly recommend these.",5,B08FCGLYFZ,Colour: Chill Grey,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Jacob Cain,Great Sound but Uncomfortable Headband,"The sound and earpads on these headphone are the best I have tried.There is a special slider to adjust the ""sensory bass"" built into the headphones.  It's a very cool feature, but I'm not much of a bass guy so I typically leave the bass turned all the way down.  If you turn it up it makes the bass very loud and vibratey, which is kind of fun? but seems bad for my ears/brain.  I didn't really realize it was there when I ordered the headphones, but it's definitely not a problem since you can just turn off if you don't like it.Without the sensory bass turned up, the sound is my favorite out of all the headphones I have tried.  I could hear little audio details I'd never heard before in songs I'd listened to many times before.  In my opinion the sound is very well balanced.Though there is no Active Noise Cancellation, the ears seal well and naturally block out some sound.  I wore during a road trip and was able to fall asleep in a car with a bunch of other people in it.The USB-C charging and the 3.5mm audio jack are both nice to have.  The bluetooth works well and the range is good.  Controls (volume, play/pause) were also fine.It has a semi-protective fabric bag to carry itself and its cords.  Definitely not as protective as a hard case, but nice to have.  The headphones themselves seem durable enough, though it seems they do have a plastic hinge to fold up, so I don't know.  Maybe it's the weight that makes them feel durable.HEADBAND: DEALBREAKER :(It has a notch at the top of the head, which just gets too uncomfortable for me when wearing these for a long time.  The cushioning is not as soft as you might think, it's a weird kind of stiff rubbery-plastic feel. It doesn't feel cheap but it's just not comfortable.  It is not soft or leather-feeling like you might think, and it just has this weird uncomfortable gap at the top.  Why?The headband was more uncomfortable than even headphones with no cushioning (like the Skullcandy Riff), because of the notch at the top and perhaps the weight.  These are the heaviest headphones I have tried, which might be okay if they had better headband cushioning.  I wish the cushioning on the headband was better, because I really like everything else about these headphones.I half want to try and mod the headband, do something DIY and make it more comfortable.  For now though, these headphones are a bit too expensive to risk that on.  Their price of $140 is just too much for me to spend on something that's not comfortable out of the box, so I will be returning them.",3,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Ben,"Great sound, needs tweaking to be balanced.","I am writing this review as a music teacher with experience in music technology and instrumental band, as well as work with FL Studio, Ableton Live, LMMS and GarageBand. Below are my thoughts on these headphones:Pros: These headphones are fun to use and listen to! I needed a wireless replacement for a pair of wired Skullcandy headphones I had. I have long used and loved skull candy products for their powerful bass and excellent durability. These headphones will satisfy even the most hardcore bass enthusiast with the subwoofer feature. Connection was a breeze and after tweaking with EQ and various settings I got a sound I was much happier with (better balance between highs, mids, and bass). Ultimately that will give you a better experience!Cons: While I love bass and enjoy listening to it thoroughly, the sound on these between mids and highs could be a bit better. I seemed to lose highs a little bit with my standard EQ settings. I will share my recommendation to improve the sound below as well. The ears will fit over most ears but there��s not much room to spare there but it��s not uncomfortable by any means.Recommendation for better sound (iPhone users): Go into your Music settings on the iPhone and scroll down to EQ. Select �JAZZ��. This will make the highs pop better without sacrificing bass and making it sound �tinny��. Also utilize the app for setting up your personal sound.I am very pleased with my headphones and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a fun music experience when they listen to their music! Skull candy continues to deliver with an exciting product and I would buy this again in the future.",4,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Mr Horse,Best headphones I have ever purchased!,"I purchased these as a replacement for my ageing Crusher Wireless headphones which were suffering from wear and tear. Those were already a very good set of cans, but the Crusher Evo is next level!The sound quality is fantastic, and a step up from the Wireless, offering much deeper bass as the Evo can pick up more frequencies than its older brother. The mids and highs are also much better. And as with all Crushers, there is a bass slider. Don't want as much bass? Just slide it all the way down to get a nice balanced sound.You can also link them with the Skullcandy app and use either 3 preset sound profiles (Music, Movie and Podcast) or create a personal profile. They can also be linked to the Tile app in case you lose them.And finally, as with most wireless headphones, you can use them wired. Simply plug in a 3.5mm audio cable (there is one included) into the line in jack on the headphones.Yes these are an expensive set of cans, but are they value for money?

The Hepatic bass or the artificial bass produced by the crusher is not impressive. It does not make the audio quality better or nice in any way. Too many vibrations. Some songs feel nice where there is extra bass but in this case, too many variations and poor quality of the bass drivers make listening the worst experience.

SamSam,These are IT!,"After using AirPods at the gym and having them constantly falling out or getting loose or the battery dying, I decided to do something about it. I saw plenty of people wearing over the ear headphones at my gym, so I decided to do a little research. These particular headphones kept coming up as great headphones for the gym with a super long battery life, intense bass, and high quality sound that could be adjusted to your hearing preferences. I was like �ok�� I��ll try them out. Boy, am I glad I did! They completely live up to the hype and THEN some! The photo above is from the app that you can use to adjust the sound to your preferences and keep track of the battery life. I��ve had these headphones for a month and I have literally only charged them the day I received them. I use them for 2 hours on average 4 times a week and they are STILL at 100% charged! And the sound quality, don��t get me started on that��suffice it to say that the bass booster isn��t even needed and you will want to adjust it to your own ears. The sound is divine. Divine. They also stay on my head no matter what I��m doing in the gym. I can be upside down and they are STILL exactly where I placed them on my head! Do yourself a favor, get these headphones!",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
ES,Mind your ears!,"This headphone is very capable of deafening you permanently in minutes. No joke, do not recommend giving them to young children as it could quite easily harm their hearing forever! Headphones are very well made and ooze good quality. Not keen on the carry pouch as opposed to the much nicer cases. But even the pouch is top quality materials and perfectly adequate for it job. I thoroughly recommend using the Skullcandy app to get the most out of your phone. Crusher EVO even comes with a built in tile tracker. Not sure why? Using a parametric equalizer is essential to get the most out of these VERY loud headphones. Its quality of sound is surprisingly good. But these are about bass, lots and lots of bass! There is a manual bass slider on the headphones and well places actual buttons for controlling your media. Comfort is not great. Ear wells are very small and the head cushion is not well designed and pressed down hard after a while. But, these are not something you will want to use for hours and hours. Because they are so powerful! It's really like being too close to the main speakers at a rock concert.....on your head! They don't use traditional drivers and as such can get more range without muddling the mids highs and lows. These are fun, not to be taken too seriously. If you like really punchy bass, read, BASS and have access to IEM'S or open backs, then get them. They are really fun! These are seriously powerful headphones and you only get one set of ears. But, you don't need the volume to get the bass as its got it from the bottom of the dial! It's a solid headphone. Well made and look great. Battery life is amazingly good 40 to 50 hours easy and it just feels nice, everything is just done right. I like mine and when I want to feel like I'm at a concert they work wonders. Movies sound excellent! No ANC and no LDAC is a shame. But who needs ANC? Trust me, you won't hear anything apart from your music! LDAC missing is a shame. But they still sound good. Can be used wired and have a port on each ear. Some people think they have motors in them to just vibrate the bass. They don't! They don't use traditional speaker cones and that sound is real! They are just fun, very loud and very well made headphones. For this price point you can't do much better. 10/10 Recommended.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Roger Morales,These are a GAME CHANGER.,"These headphones are F*****G awesome. Buy them. Buy them right now. Even if they are on sale, buy them. These headphones changed the way I listened to music. The bass is so clear and crisp and it really can get brain-rattling, depending on the song your listening to of course. I was blown away by how great the quality of the bass was when I turned the slider all the way up. Absolutely no distortion at all. I never thought listening to music would be this awesome but these headphones make that happen. With the slider down the quality is meh. But your not getting these headphones to not use the slider. These headphones are specifically designed for bass heads who love the bass thumping beats when listening to their favorite songs. It��s like having mini subs for your ears. No regrets buying these. Like I said, these are GAME CHANGERS y��all, and I know you won��t regret buying these when you do.",5,B093STJV1G,Colour: Dark Blue,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Gabriel V.Gabriel V.,Buena calidad en general,"Mis favoritos hasta ahora, son unos muy buenos aud�fonos Bluetooth. Viene muy bien presentado con una caja de buena calidad, viene con un cable de carga usb-c y otro cable jack para conectarlos v�a alambrica, tambin con un bolso para guardarlos, la parte de adentro del bolso es de tela, muy parecido al terciopelo.Los aud�fonos me llegaron con un poco de bater�a y me duraron como una semana. Su bater�a si dura las 40 horas.En muchos lados dicen que estos aud�fonos son enfocados espec�ficamente para los bajos y es cierto pero tambin funcionan excelente con canciones que incluyen medios y altos. Lo especial de estos aud�fonos es el regulador para la intensidad de los bajos, el cual hace que vibren al ritmo de la musica.Recomiendo estos en vez de los aud�fonos skullcandy crusher normales, ya que estos tienen bajos mejorados, mejor calidad de los materiales, dos aplicaciones para crear tu sonido personalizado y para poder encontrarlos v�a bluetooth o con un sonido que hacen por si los pierdes.Totalmente recomendado.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

They cost more than these.(during release) But do not deliver quite the same experience.Now I do admit in my opinion beats look more appealing than the crushers.But when it comes to sound quality.I would rate beats around 6-7.5These would easily be 8-9 perhaps higher the more I listen.I��m not an audiophile, I love the bass and how this consumes you and teleports you to another dimension.Awesome product.

Joachim Schmidt,Hammer Teil,"Das ist nun mein zweiter Skullcandy. Vor vier Jahren habe ich mir den Crusher gekauft, inzwischen die Ohrpolster gewechselt, ansonsten luft dieser ohne Probleme. Selbst die Akkulaufzeit hlt dieser noch. Vom Klang ansich war ich vom ersten Tag an begeistert. Eine besseres Klangvolumen und einen derart fetten Bass erhlt man nur bei Skullcandy.Letztes Jahr musste mal wieder ein neues Teil her und ich habe mich f�r den Crusher Evo entschieden. Und das war ganu die richtige Wahl. Die Verarbeitung ist einach top, nichts wackelt und der Klang ist der Hammer, nochmal strkere Bsse als beim Crusher, aber trotzdem ein total ausgewogenes Klangbild und trotz Bassvolumen klare Hhen. Weiterer Voteil zum Crusher: Man hrt so gut wie nichts nach auen. Beim Crusher hat sich die Frau bei entsprechnder Lautstrke schon mal bechwert.Betreibe diesen mittlerweile mit einem Sennheiser BT T 100, optimale Kombination.Ich habe schon viele Kopfhrer besessen, aber keiner der Gerte hatte solch ein Preis-Leistungsverhltnis.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Tanara Petrova,Amazing for people with normal sized ears,"These are the ones I tried so hard to like. I love the sound quality, I love that the bass is literally tangible. They feel sturdy, they look great, and they are really intuitive to use. Unfortunately, like with many over ear headphones, they are not comfortable for her to wear for more than a half hour at a time. The ear cups are too small for my enormous ears. The bottom of the cup presses just a tiny bit on the helix of my ear. At first this isn't a big deal, but after about 20 minutes it starts to hurt. I have tinnitus and I use music to drown it out at work, so I need to be able to wear a headset for 10-12 hours a day. These just don't work for that.",3,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Amazon Customer,"Bass is FAKE, sound quality and volume is TOO LOW.","Bought these for my son to replace a pair of Beats (that never last very long). Read tons of reviews and was excited to hear the headphones.Instantly disappointed.I kept trying to turn the volume up... even though it was at max. Headphones are not loud enough.Sound quality was lousy. No layers in the music. Sounded one-dimensional.Also, I noticed the bass was louder on one side than the other. I switched songs and it never improved.The bass is a gimmick. It doesn't feel or sound like real bass. It sounds/feels like there is a vibration rather than actual bass. Almost like there is a vibration motor that just vibrates the crap out of the headphones rather than supplying actual bass.Extremely disappointed. Returned them immediately and went with the more expensive Bose headphones. We'll see how those turn out.",2,B093STJV1G,Colour: Dark Blue,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Omar S.,Cmo fan�tico del bass te digo...,"Los aufonos brillan en dos cosas una es la calidad de los materiales y la presentacin.Est�n regulares en cuanto a el sonido tengo unos Hesh2 Wireless y se escuchan muy similar si no activas el Bass (esos me costaron $1,400), lo que si mejora es la calidad del micrfono. En cuanto a lo ""importante"" del producto, si te retumba toda la materia gris con el bass, pero, hasta cierto punto es incmodo e innecesario a el nivel tan extremo al que llega, aunque,lo que m�s desepciona es el hecho de que al llevarlo a el ""m�ximo potencial"" tratan de hacer todo pero no llega a nada, los bajos dejan de ser profundos y se convierten en una vibracin que va al ritmo de algo, los medios se pierden y los agudos lastiman. En conclusin al llevarlo a un cierto nivel (+60% de volumen y a m�s de 1/4 de el control de bajos) pierden toda la calidad del sonido y se convierten en un masajeador de orejas que l�stima con sus agudos. Me hubiera gustado que limitar�n un poco m�s la vibracin (nadie en su sano juicio los va a llevar al 100% de bajos) y dedicar�n eso a la calidad del resto del sonido. Si quieren unos buenos bajos sin perder la calidad de sonido me ir�a por unos Sony con Extra Bass, tuve unos y chulada de sonido (solo consideren que algunos de esa l�nea tienden a ser de construccin fragil).",2,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
Bryce Van Horn,Do not consider these headphones. Complete garbage.,"Full stop. I have used pc audio equipment before sound blaster was a company. These headphones, will work for smart phones, but that is where their support stops. If you want to use them on a PC with windows. Make sure you have the correct Bluetooth version to support them. Then on PC and Linux. It works one day, then it doesn't the next.These headphones have a gimmick, where they use haptic feed drivers to buzz your ears to mimic a bass response frequency.  The gimmick works and makes you think you should turn down the volume to avoid damaging your ear drums.So ok, the gimmick works, but your connection to Bluetooth hardware is is a joke. There are much better headphones on the market, that are not charging a premium like skull candy. First and last purchase for steal candy from me.",1,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

Mihai S.,Absolutely amazing!,"First, the packaging is amazing! The box is wrapped in plastic and held closed with some magnets. You open it and the presentation is everything you would expect and then some. The pouch that it comes in is the most rugged and heavy duty heaphone pouch I have ever seen and it also has a plastic clips to hold the opening tighter.For accesories, you will receive a wire with microphone on it, for wired connection. A wire without microphone on it for wored connections. A charging cable, type A to type C.The comfort is absolutely excellent! They are not the lightest, as they have battery to last 30h inside, more on that later, the electronics, drivers and the vibration modules. That being said, the leather that touches your ears is so soft! I've never felt such soft leather! It has some nice feeling foam inside and that makes it feel light, comfortable and not too hot on your ears. The top bit that touches your head, is a more rubbery kind of material, is a bit stronger than the earpads but it's made just right, to not give you awful headache after extensive usage. The band also has another type of leather that is rougher on the top side with some very small writing on it.The connection is dead simple, you hold the power button down until they turn on and you hear a second voice saying ""pairing"". You just search for them on your device and click connect. That's it. On the right earphone you'll find volume buttons as well as a round button for play, pause. pPrevious/next track can be done by holding volume buttons. The round button can be configured to trigger your AI assistant like Google assistant, probably Siri as well with a double click. On the left earphone you find only power button and a slider button for the amount of bass you want. This will also make it feel like it's louder, though, only the bass is being amplified with some neat vibration modules. I believe it's the same type of vibration modules as a phone has, but the enclosure makes the sound amplified and it sounds amazing. It literally makes you feel the wax in your ears is coming out on the right song. I usually kept it at just a little above the minimum as you don't need a lot to shake your brains inside your skull.The battery life is on point. It says 30 hours per charge, I believe it. You let it charge properly and you'll recharge them once every 2 weeks or so. It's great! If you're in a hurry they can charge a few hours of playback in about 10 minutes. Fantastic!The sound quality, for the price, is unbeatable. There just isn't anything out there to actually shake your brains out with this amount of comfort and flexibility. You get wired connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, 30 hours of battery life and so much more. That is even more substantiated as I got them on offer for �120 if I'm not mistaken. The only reason I didn't gave them 5 stars for sound quality is because obviously, there are more audiophile oriented headphones out there that can reproduce the music more accurately as the producer intended. These headphones are not for that thkugh, are for people that want a bit more bass in their lives. Of course, when I say a bit, I mean all of it! By blasting them on full volume and setting them on my bed, I can still hear the music while the bass is feeling through the mattress and you can hear it pretty well. It's insane and I love it! The reason I kept my bass volume just over the minimum, is that if you do go on full bass blast, sometimes it might get muddy and it's not that much of a difference really. I prefered less bass volume, so it would reproduce it the best and even feel it better maybe.It has app for your phone and a built in tile. I actually lost them once and used the tile thing to find them, it was pretty cool. I think you can make them play a sound so you can hear them as you get closer. The app is cool does some neat things, but I didn't bother too much with it. I did though, personalized the sound for my ears. Each person has a different hearing and this will help you to fine tune the sound a bit. There are some EQs but that can be done from most smartphones too.Sadly I had to return them as one of the earpads got split in half almost. That is almost one year later and yeah, it's probably just me being unlucky. Though, that really soft leather is glued to another piece that holds it in place. That's what failed I think, the glue keeping them together or something. I just returned them today but I am now torn between the new sonys and these. I do not believe sony has a better bass than these but a lot of great functions for basically twice the money. I don't know if it's worth it. These are world class in their segment.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,
WF,haptic dingdongs work surprisingly well with some types of music,"Straight to business, let's address the cons (kind of) or misconceptions about these headphones. Yes, there is real bass but if you're expecting the headphones to shake out of how much bass there actually is, don't. As you've probably noticed already the bass slider isn't really for the adjusting how much bass there is inside of the headphones, but basically adjusting the haptic motors (the stuff in controllers and whatnot that makes them vibrate) . Also, these headphones are actually on the quieter side of headphones so if you were looking for loud headphones, look elsewhere. The sensory bass doesn't always work with a lot of songs and actually murders some of them, acting as a very annoying vibrator when you have it turned on. Alright, now that all of the cons I could think of are out of the way, let's go on to the pros.The build quality is good, doesn't feel like I could break them unless I actually wanted to. They fit very nicely on my head ( what with the rotating earcups and flexibility and all ) I still have to adjust them sometimes but I think that goes for all headphones.The fact that these aren't that loud are actually fine, I wear these for long periods of time ( don't want that tinnitus ).Even my gripe with the fact that these murder some songs when you have the bass slider turned up, is kind of canceled out with the fact that you can just adjust it or just straight up turn it off for songs it just doesn't work with.I really like putting these on with lo-fi music, the haptic motors really give extra oomph to the kicks and since these aren't that (hot?) in terms of tuning, I feel like it's a fun and pleasant experience with this genre and has mainly been what I've been using it for.5/5 not what I bought it for but all things considered I'll take it.",5,B08FCGH2RL,Colour: Black,SKULLCANDY,Headphones,

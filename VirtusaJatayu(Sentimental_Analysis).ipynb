            "The media could not be loaded.  Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.1) Large Curved  Display in this price category - 1.69 inch2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby  while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.7) BT Music Control, Weather âï¸ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.2)  Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40  seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer.  In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while  traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.Few  other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :1) Torch ð¦ - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.2) Remote shutter button for camera.3) Call silencing option could have been added.\n",

I got this as a gift and let me tell it's one of the most amazing gift I have ever received. It's a smart watch you would love to have. It's not just classy but efficient too. And it comes with a built in Alexa Voice Assistant.The display is perfect to view without strain to your eyes.You may set multiple watch faces.It automatically adjusts the screen brightness.It has a guided Meditative Breathing and Stress Monitor.And the most important feature in the today's pandemic state Heart Rate & SPO2 monitoring.I am discovering so much more every single day.\"\n",
            "Pros: Good battery life and good looks (when screen not on)Cons:1. The display is not at all colorful. It is so dull that it actually makes you dislike the watch. C'mon that's the least expectation from a 4k watch. Display is really really dull and bad.2. Doesn't connect to Google Fit. Well, it does in theory but the steps taken in watch won't ever be updated in your Google fit account. So if you've taken insurance and get discounts with steps taken (my agenda), it doesn't fullfill that agenda.3. Steps count are inaccurate and doesn't match at times. The app keeps logging out and when you log back in, it mismatches the steps4. I wore it at night to check my sleep, and I couldn't find any record in the app next morning. In fact, it is still showing only one day sleep recorded on July 8th for 3 hours. Guess I'm a sleepless zombie now..Verdict: Don't go for this clock. Many wonderful options available at this budget.\n",

Lags, even more, when you see extra characters in messages.4. Not accurate at all, for accuracy, I'd give 30 out of 100. Counted steps even when I was sleeping, guess how many? 500 - 600 steps...

            "I have been using this for more than a day now and so far I am impressed . I loved the color and model , it looks pretty good ! Pedometer , sleep , spo2 , stress monitors are mostly accurate . The auto brightness feature is great .There is no lag with notifications But the UI is lagging a bit . It takes 2-3 secs to turn on sometimes , Similarly Alexa too takes around 5 secs . After one day usage battery dropped from 100 to 70% so one full charge may last for 3-4 days . Overall i am satisfied so far .\n",
            "I have received this product a couple of days ago and now I am going to give an honest review of it.This product is a great item if you are looking for a budget smartwatch. For its price, it provides quite accurate measurements of your BPM, stress, SPO2 etc. I have verified it's measurements with an actual oximeter and it proved to be accurate. However, the pedometer of the watch randomly adds around 100 steps. The pedometer is accurate otherwise.The touch display of the 1.69\" watch impressed me. The watch has a sharp display, and smooth touch, which makes you feel like you are on a smartphone. The response time is quite well too. However, the animations lag which is not very eye pleasing, but workable.The battery is great. The watch would be powered on for one whole night and would not lose a single percent of battery. Even while using, it loses a reasonable amount of power. For first time users, who just received their product: You might notice the battery is draining extremely quick. Do not panic. It is recommended to charge the battery for at least 2 hours before first use. It stabilizes the battery. The next time you use your watch, it would work as normal.The built-in Alexa is perhaps my favorite feature of this watch. It's response time is around 5 seconds, and is quite fun to use a virtual assistant on the go. It can tell you facts, jokes, weather, calculations, translations and loads of other stuff, which might be useful for quickly looking up something. However, Alexa does not have a speaker. It gives a text output. The text output can sometimes end with \"...\" (ellipses) which mean the output is too long to print. It can also fail to provide relevant output at times.You need to log in to Alexa with your Amazon account in the boAt Wave App.There are 100+ watch faces in the wave app, which you can use to customize your watch with whatever that suits your personality. You can even use your own pictures. However, you cannot customize the time font if you choose to do that, which, in my opinion, is quite limiting.Notifications in the watch is pretty cool, and comes in handy when you do not wish to open your phone for it. Call alerts come, and you can reject them but not accept. Makes sense as the watch does not have a speaker. It vibrates.It has a good build quality and is water-resistant.Other cool features are sleep tracking, breathing exercise, alarms, timers, flashlights etc.Overall, a pretty decent watch if you are looking for something in this range of price.\n",
            "I used this watch almost for a month and found few issues like it doesn't track your sleep accurately but that's doesn't matter for most of us.Alexa built in feature doesn't work at all. It's says doesn't recognise everytime.It is perfect for swimmers, gym lovers, running and other type of activities.Looks good and mostly suits on all casual wears.Battery life is good and goes for 3-4 days with full charge.With normal usage battery goes for a week sometimes.Hope someone find this review helpful!!\n",
            "- boat wave is almost 90 percentage copy of veryfit app, which works a little bit better that boat wave app- sleep tracking was not accurate.- pedometer is won't track the steps as good as Google fit or pacer app- you won't be able to share the data with Google fit app ,this app is being blocked by Google as it tried to access the sensitive info in your Google account account.- overall build quality is nice but may be this is rebranded version of some Chinese watch.- App UI lags a bit.\n",

Memory for watch faces is limited to less then 10. everytime you need a new watch face you have to download in mobile app (you have to remove the last one you have installed to down load new). you can not just browse on the watch for watch faces and select the one you want.

            "Look wise great product. But important point is there is no BT calling features &at this price range you will get BT features easily in other brand.\n",
            "I want to return it as it does not have Bluetooth calling feature.otherwise look, quality is superb in this price.\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  This watch is my first smart watch and I can tell you one thing if you are looking for a budget friendly product go for it but there's only one thing i didn't like is the glitchy LCD screen everything else is fine\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  I was so excited before I get the watch....but  after holding it to my hand I m little disappointed because of Alexa performance.. although I purchased this watch only for Alexa but it has limited Alexa command and give you answer in text..so boring.... it's better to buy Bluetooth calling watch ­ at this price\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  1. Watch is good looking and stylish on wrist.2. Accuracy is 90% in 15 days of use.3. Battery performance is low about 2.5 days on Realtime Heart rate measurement mode. In Auto mode its about 4.5 to 5 days.4. Screen responce is not upto the mark boat has to work on firmware and screen quality also resolution is not that much good.5. Strap is very fine and flexible.6. User interface is lagy may be an update will fix the bugs if there is any.7. Overall good product to wear not to measure.It will give u better look with low accuracy and low screen responce and resolution.\n",

            "\"Firstly Best price as compared to other smartwatches available in market .Comes with one year brand warranty . Strap quality is great as compared with other same budget smartwatch.You can store upto 7 watch faces as wallpaper. There are many sports features on this watch. Heart rate data in this watch is pretty accurate (I  compared with apple watch). It supports all day stress monitoring. Weather feature shows u upto 2 days forecast. There are many more features like alarm, workout modes, sleep, breath monitor, steps count, Alexa built in & many more.you can refer manual guideBest & recommended to go for in this budget\"\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  My 1st Smartwatch from Boat. Believe me guys its \"Bang for the Buck\".Bought in 1st Sale @2999, quite surprised by the performance. HR & SpO2 Accuracy is top notch.Well built, feels sturdy in hand.USEFUL FEATURES/PROS 1.69\" HD Super Bright Display.Automatic Sports Mode Detection is superb.HR & SpO2 Accuracy 90%.

            "I am suggesting thi product for those who love boat smartwatchs... I am using thi watch from one year.. Battery backup is almost 10 days and works properly\n",
            "The Product was too good , looks classy too but the payment method which I have done order through Amazon payment. It was the worst experience I have ever had before, I ordered with Amazon pay with coupon dedection with the amount of Rs.100 But after that My amount was debited but the order couldn't placed then I ordered with COD option without any dedection amount... Don't use Amazon pay while ordering... Apart from payment method the product was Too gud I loved itâ¤ï¸ Must buy\n",
            "Caller name is not appearing during call. It shows as \"unknown\" even after approving permission for call logs and contacts. Raised a request in boat wave app. If is not resolved within 3 days will return the product.Rest all features are good. So giving 3 star for overall quality of product.\n",
            "After 1 month it stopped working in spite we just used few times and kept it safe the display is blank and no option to return even though it is under warranty.Totally waste of money.Also pathetic issue is even though we bought the product in amazon they will not take the responsibility, they will just show their had to the brand.But if we have bought in the shop will the shop keeper say the same ............. he would take some responsibility of the same.Difference between online and offline. Online is only for that particular moment will not take any responsibility.If every thing is fine then online if some thing goes wrong they just show hand we order online to save time but if some thing goes wrong we spend more time trying to rectify for the same.This is my experience words............... after a long time realized that offline is much more better then online :)\n",
            "I love this product it is amazing I am really folling  in love with it ,it has so amazing features\n",
            "Not satisfied. Overall looks good but sensors not accurate and Alexa wont work and fitting not good. Be careful on return policy. Fitting was not good so requested for replacement but denied saying even replacement is not possible. Just regretted for buying this. Just 2 months back had taken boat noise cancellation head phone. It was great product. With same impression I took this also but my bad\n",
            "Good productI hv used this product since 1 year\n",
            "Everyone must buy this watch because it's tracking and voice assistance is good , if you are swimmers the  watch is best choice\n",
            "Good\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  Sleep tracking mobile app or accuracy is best\n",
            "Dear Amazon team. Please find the attached short video clip.The problem is Caller name not showing.only showing Unknown. Otherwise everything is good kindly suggest ASAP\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  Looks goodTracking is okayish , I usually wear this whole day n night - specially in my weight training sessions.Cant really trust the sleep trackingAlexa worksGood connection with ios as wellFor more info connect with me in Instagram- Parijatsarkar1\n",
            "Firstly I need to tell no need to buy watches like noise colorfit pro 3 and realme watch S which are 5000 or 4500 in price this is very nice watch under 5k...Its display is very good...It has no lag...Wake gestire is working nice...And most importantly ALEXA BUILT IN ....which is amazing in this price point...In the end I would say it's a very good budget watch...Must Buy\n",
            "First thing which really impressive about Boat Xtend is the display size and design,It feels good and looks nice on wrist. The automated screen brightness makes it an easy affair for day or night watchers, Built in Alexa is simply an amazing add on to enhance user experience, Multiple Watch faces is definitely good thing to customize everything as per your need.Overall the watch itself a complete package.\n",
            "Sleep tracking is accurate but not stress monitoring. The UI lags a lot. The Alexa doesn't work as of now. It does login you in dedicated app for android. Unable to use custom faces because. There are a lot of issues in application. The UI can be fixed if they add animations and improve performance from software side by an OTA update. Not sure they will release OTA update soon fir this specific watch. Simply, the watch on the exterior looks great but it performs very bad at software performance. It has a lot if issues. Perhaps, the developers for this watch should improve the user applications(playstore app) and release a new software update soon before people just buy and return the product after 3-4 days of usage.\n",
            "The only thing i like about this watch is its build and display size and there are many other problems in this watch like their is no REM sleep tracking support it has a option but it didn't work and GPS connection is also not working battery life is only for 2 days and the highlighted feature that is alexa support is very slow and the software is so buggy and laggy the transitions are not smooth as it have to be you can but it only for screen size and build thats it . If you want a decent watch buy realme watch 2 or amazfit bip u they both are far better than this in this price range\n",
            "the music was definitely not working and there is no cameraand every time we have to connect to the phone again\n",
            "Excellent watch, I bought to monitor steps on daily basis, and this watch approximately +/- 5 deviation it shows, satisfied product worth to buy\n",
            "Good product, good battery, alisa not enough\n",
            "Over all I love this product  esasy to use . I am gonna buy  again .. so nice product\n",
            "If you're reading the reviews to decide whether or not to buy this watch, I'll sum it up in one word: DON'T. It's not worth it.I bought this last year in June and initially it worked fine. But within 3 weeks from the date of delivery, the wake up gesture function stopped working. So I went to the service center as per the address given on Boat website but there they refused to service the product and redirected me to another service center. And guess what? There too, they said that they do not provide service for boat smartwatches. So I had to travel to yet another center which is not even in Kolkata but in the Suburban area to get my product exchanged. The scenario at this place was yet more disappointing. There was long queue of people and most of them had issues related to smartwatches that started malfunctioning within days of purchase. The place is grossly understaffed and in no way capable of handling the huge rush they get everyday, thanks to the low quality products that the company is selling. Anyway, took me nearly 4 hours to submit my watch and I got a replacement delivered to my house within 1 week. It was all good until a couple of days ago, I found out that the watch is malfunctioning. The wake up gesture is not working yet again along with other problems. I'm too frustrated to go through the ordeal of exchanging the product again cause frankly, the experience at the service center was nothing short of a nightmare. Any product that requires multiple replacements within warranty period is definitely not worth the time or energy.I think the people writing positive reviews here are the ones who got lucky with their products or just wrote the review too soon before using it for a while. From my experience, they manufacture and deliver too many faulty products and that's a real harrassment to the people who buy it. So yes, long story short, I would definitely NOT recommend buying this garbage that they are calling a smartwatch. It will save both your money and time.\n",
            "Am totally satisfied with the product everything is super good even Alexa but you need to stay paired with your phone to use the Alexa feature rest all is good about it but could be better in pairing range...\n",
            "Boat products are known for quality. However the first one was faulty. Got fast replacement. Good product.\n",
            "Noise is best...it's very useful product\n",
            "Nice watch correctly fit to my hand \n",
            "This one was little expensive but ok go for it\n",
            "Been using it for a while now.Tracking features are nearly accurate.sleep tracking doesnt really works like the other features.Loads of watch faces to choose from, liked that part.Alexa works super good for me, catches even the slightest of voice.Bluetooth connectivity worked great intially, but had to go to the app and connect, for it to work later in the month.Built quality is amazing, looks pretty aesthetic and costly from outside, good if u wanna flex.Message and call notifications work absolutely fine, except from the times when u turn them off, and need to start over again with providing permissions.The pixels and display is amazing, no doubt.Find my phone is a really great feature if you're somebody who usually happens to loose their phone in ur room.Conclusion: Worth the price.\n",
            "I have been using this smart watch for over 7 weeks regularly. It captures sleep details well. However, captures incorrect health (fitness) data. For example, if I start working out but forget to switch on the associated sports mode, it doesn't capture any calorie burning. On the other hand, if I switch on a sports mode while sitting idle, it shows increased heart rate and burnt calories. So basically the watch has pre-fed data for each sport mode and the watch displays that. The watch is useless then. The app is bad!!!! Hangs frequently. I won't recommend buying this (un)smart watch.\n",
            "\n",
            "Negative features:\n",
            "Good smartwatch! Will not say worth buying, but yes if you are looking for a smartwatch at a reasonable price then this is the one. However, you need to charge it for 2hrs mandatorily for the battery to work smoothly.Notifications pop up multiple times and you will have to delete 1 notification for 4-5 times.Kms tracking is not that great. Where google fit shows 4.81 kms, this watch will show 3.48kms.The vibration is very bad. There is no option to decrease the intensity of the vibration.\n",
            "This was a gift for my mother and am not in India. It has been such an ordeal to have this product replaced or returned. It looks fugly on the wrist and has below average battery life too. Because they have just replacement option, we have been trying to get another color. However, there is no option to replace it! Plus I cannot get in touch with any rep at Amazon India! It is my worst experience with any ecommerce orgn so far! Absolutely frustrating and ridiculous.\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  I ordered the day it launched.. Delivery was quick as I received the watch very next day..Packaging was simple came with smartwatch, warrantycard, charging cable, etcI will divide my review in Like and Dislike about the watch..Likes~*Looks stylish big screen*Great Features*Good price*Value for moneyDislikes~*it lags when going from one feature to other*No flashlight as written in description*there comes 10-15 notifications of the same notifications from whatsApp and YouTube which gets irritating*wake-up screen delays in waking about 1-2 seconds*there is minute screen bleeding in watch*Battery backup is not more than four days even after closing continuous HR monitorConclusion:- This watch needs serious firmware update on notifications problem and wake-up screen problem.. Overall good product in this price rangeIt's been three days only, Will update more after few months of use\n",
            "There are multiple issues.. I have been using this for 2 weeks now1. There is no touch on the watch2. Battery back up lasts 1 day if you wear for 12 hours everyday3. There is no clock face that shows you the current battery status4. Just like your phone.. you have to charge it every day..\n",
            "They didnt mention about calling option. I purchase it for 3499/- totally waste .u can use it only for fitness watch for this amt.they doesn't have return policy too . So pls think twice before u purchase. I contacted manufacturer first he said he wont specify about calling option. So he wont take return for this reason. Cotacted amazon customer they gave irresponsible reply .Pls dont purchase this type of items through online ... very bad experience i had today .Its not upto the mark . You will get better option for this rate\n",
            "Good watch with nice features like SPO2 monitoring,  BP monitoring and heart rate monitoring.Touchscreen response is sloppy and irritating sometimes.Otherwise all goodJust be careful while buying anything other than black strap, the colour you see and that arrives may be different.I ordered a peach pink colour but got baby pink instead, and despite change request several times ...am-zn and seller denied my request. (This is one of those times I felt I should've bought this from a physical shop so that I could handle the return physically,  the customer service here is a joke.)\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  I dont know what people at Boat are doing. Why cant you make an reliable product? Just import from china put your brand name and sell , thats all you know..The watch wasn't in use for 20-30 days and then it didnt turn on even after charging it, basically it became dead. I placed replacement request with boat. Got a replacement watch.Again after some months same thing is happening with the new watch. The screen is ON but it is not responding.. I found out, if the device is idle or not in use for a while it become DEAD automatically and doesnt even work after charging.\n",
            "I had purchased this product on 13th December 2021, and within 15 days around 29th December 2021, a small part of the watch broke whish is why i can't even connect the strap to the watch. And this happened while i tried to wear the watch and not due to and fall or anything else. And i contacted the boat support for both online and offline solutions and they said that this is not covered under their warranty and they say i don'thave any other option as they don't even repair it. I am really disappointed in this boat product as i have used other boat products but didn't expect this kind of product from boat.\n",
            "There was a small cut at the Strap slot. I have been trying to reach the Boat Service centers,Customer cares, Complaints,mails and what not. They are tragically bad. I always preferred boat because of it being a start up and Indian Company and I completely support (Make in India) but their reply of follow up is literally nil,They did even register a complaint.very very very very very bad service. Literally unhappy.Now I understand why people prefer Apple products and not Indian made products.I repent a lot for choosing BoAt.Very very unhappy dejected upset angry and irritated with the customer service...\n",
            "I was excited to see so many features in the phone with bugetted price. But then was sad to see no option to pick a call through smart watch.\n",
            "The watch has good looks but there are many things missing.. Like when you listen to the song.. Name of the song does not come on the screen..Also gets disconnected quickly and gets connected again..Alexa is useless here.. It doesn't work very well or very useful if you already have a big alexa speaker.. You will feel this is stupid.\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  Its totally useless watch on 7th day it started to hang as you all can see this video and when I returned this product their agent took away the product but they didn't give me back my refund they are saying some other item is recieved so no refund will be initiated I am very upset with amazon and its service plus also from boat\n",
            "Pls don't advertise that this model's battery will last for 7 days with a * stating that if it's on it will last for 2 days. Do I need to turn off the watch often 5o have the charge on for 7 days? It's not even withholding the charge for 1.5 days. Pls buy some other models in the market and test it before you release a product. At least copy their technology and use it in your models to have long battery life. Waste of money.\n",
            "Worst watch when i searched for it it shown as blood pressure measurement and now the technician is tellng me you must search the device forst before order but if the search result shows blood pressure measurement then how public will understand??They will not return the product .. doing this type of fraud is highly disrespectful for a brand like Boat and a amazon both\n",
            "The product is still in learning phase... There are many bugs, since it is connected to you phone via Bluetooth, the phone misbehaves sometimes...It does repetitive actions and hangs.... The only solution being restarting the phone....I have ordered 2 products and 1 was having continuous screentime ON...Response time is also slow...Overall this product needs more work, but looks absolutely beautiful...Hope to see you soon with more fixes...\n",
            "The wake gesture of the watch just stopped working after three daysThen I paid attention to the step count and I tallied it with the health app steps of iPhone .. the accuracy is pathetic .. actual step count 1280 and the boat extend watch steps count 228I have stopped wearing it â¦Look and feel and touch experience is ok\n",
            "This watch has great features but the dial was big due to that i returned bcz my sister didn't like it.Rest watch is okay if you like big dials.Many other features in this then noise.\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  I am writing this review after 3 months of use. The watch was fine but suddenly the watch stopped responding. The watch did is not responding. Not able to turn it on or off with the power button. Neither the watch is changing. Want it to be replaced.\n",
            "I have received very bad product... The watch battery life is very bad and this product is not as expected... Really it hurts a lot... When the product battery life is not good so I have spoken to the customer care officer and I have made it to replace the item they said ok but at the time of the delivery they have send me used product... This is not fair Amazon I have trusted you a lot but this is not the right way I have paid  money to the product it's not free of cost... So I decided to not order any other products from Amazon.... Please don't buy any product from Amazon\n",
            "I ordered this product but hugely disappointed with the garbage quality product with major issues which makes it totally unusable. I want to return it and will request Amazon to consider it. I can't use it at all and need to throw awayMajor issues:- Step counting is hugely incorrect and no accuracy which makes it totally useless for me- Do not disturb mode gets enabled automatically even after disabling it- Steps goals even after changing, do not reflect- Touch screen is not responsive and very difficult to operate- Battery does not even sustain for 2 days (product description says up to 5 days)Overall this is totally useless product and I don't know how Amazon can keep these kind of sellers with garbage quality products. I request Amazon to block this seller.Regards,Vishal\n",
            "All features are useless because the watch disconnect from the mobile app every 15 minutes. So you will not receive any call notification, message, WhatsApp, etc. notification on watch. You will not be able to use a music player, Alexa, Callender through a watch. Every time you try to use any feature it will ask you to connect it with a mobile app. And when you will connect it again it will get disconnected after 15 - 20 minutes.If we have to connect it again and again with an app. Then what is the use of the watch?Highly not recommended.\n",
            "I bought it for sleep tracker as i am suffering from insomnia\n",
            "Touch not much good. Else accurate. It's app is worse. Always showing errors\n",
            "The media could not be loaded.  I bought this watch for my son, primarily for its claimed \"5 atm water resistance\". Boat claims that the watch can be used at 5 atm water pressure for upto 30 mins.However, this claim by the company is completely fraudulent. The watch lost all functionality within minutes of its first exposure to water. My son just dipped it in water for some time, and the touchscreen stopped responding thereafter, as can be seen in the video. It just goes to prove that the watch is not water resistant at all, and the company is either just making a false claim about it, or the manufacturing/ quality control processes of the company are extremely poor. Any which way, it just shows the company in a very poor light.This is exactly how people loose faith in companies, and companies end up loosing customer base. I for one, and not going to buy anything from Boat again, nor am I going to recommend Boat products to anyone.Poor show by Boat. Highly disappointing.\n",
            "I gave this 1 star because there is no option to give a lower rating. I bought the watch in March and within 2 months of light using the watch display is gone. Nothing from the app or watch is fixing it and there is no response from customer care. I love my gadgets and keep them with care, same with this watch. I really thought this was a up and coming brand with good quality products, but this is a horrible waste of money. Dont go for it, the watch does not live up to the hype.\n",
            "It harms the skin firstly, I don't know the sensor or charging point causes this. secondly it's not showing the saved names for incoming calls. Very bad experience and I'm very much disappointed. Touch screen is not so ok and you need to press the side button to see the time manually otherwise it's not blink for a while when you move your hand to see the time\n",

Disappointed ¸\n",
            "This product doesnt do what it is supposed to. The trackers are inaccurate. They differ largely with the medical trackers. So, not sure about accuracy.It disconnects from the phone every few mins and u need to reconnect. Also Alexa doesnt work at all. There is no way you can connect it. And even after a huge struggle to connect, it simply gets disconnected in a few minutes and the struggle begins again to reconnect. I have no clue what the watch is all about when nothing in it works!!I finally returned the product after a good call with Amazon! It is not recommended!\n",
            "Good I waited to review this product. Never buy electronics on Amazon. The product broke from within 1 month without much use. Ideally a smart watch is suppose to be worn for all the time an thereby I expected it to be strong but unfortunately the product did not even last for a month and the worst part is the boat service centre refused to help me stating it's a physical damage and not covered in warranty. Utter waste of money\n",
